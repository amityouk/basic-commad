Question 1: Incorrect
When creating a machine learning service to recognize text in images, what type of server should you choose to manage my computing resources?
•	 
virtual machine
(Incorrect)
•	 
cluster of virtual machines
•	 
Professional services are serverless, so they don't use servers
(Correct)
•	 
Virtual machines running Linux only
Explanation
Option 3 is the correct answer.
Google Cloud's dedicated services are serverless. Google manages computing resources for the Service.
There is no need for users to allocate or monitor virtual machines.
Question 2: Correct

You are using cache because you need to store data. How does caching affect data retrieval?
•	 
Caching improves client-side JavaScript execution
•	 
Cache continues to store data even if power is lost, increasing availability
•	 
Caches can get out of sync with the real system
•	 
Retrieving data from cache is faster than retrieving it from SSD or HDD, so using cache reduces latency
(Correct)
Explanation
Option 4 is the correct answer.
Because cache uses memory, it is the fastest storage type when it comes to reading data.
A cache is a data store on the back end of a distributed system, not on the client. Caching does not affect client-side JavaScript execution.
If power is lost, the data in the cache will not be saved. Data must be reloaded. Caches can get out of sync with the systems that source the information. This is because when such a system is updated, the cache may not be updated. Cache read speed is faster than SSD and HDD.

Why can cloud providers offer flexible resource placement?
•	 
Cloud providers can take resources from low-priority customers and provide them to high-priority customers.
•	 
Because public cloud providers have extensive resources and can move capacity quickly between multiple customers, they can provide flexible resource allocation more efficiently than smaller data centers can.
(Correct)
•	 
The more resources you use, the more expensive your cloud provider will charge you
•	 
Cloud providers don't offer flexible resource placement
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer.
Cloud providers can offer large amounts of resources and quickly allocate such resources to different customers. Cloud providers can optimize resource allocation when customers and workloads are mixed.

Option 1 is incorrect. Except for preemptible instances, cloud providers do not take resources from one customer and allocate them to another customer.

Option 3 is incorrect. Cloud providers typically offer discounts as usage increases.
Question 5: 
Skipped
Suppose a transaction occurs in which a client randomly accesses some of the files in a drive attached to a virtual machine. What type of storage system will you use?
•	 
object storage
•	 
block storage
(Correct)
•	 
NoSQL storage
•	 
SSD storage only
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer.
The connected drive is a block storage device.

Option 1 is incorrect. When object storage is used in a virtual machine, Cloud Storage buckets are used, but Cloud Storage buckets cannot be directly connected to a virtual machine.

Option 3 is incorrect; NoSQL is a type of data base, not a storage system.

Option 4 is incorrect; you can use HDDs as well as SSDs.
Question 6: 
Skipped
You are deploying a new relational database to support your web application.
What type of storage system will you use to store the database data files?
•	 
object storage
•	 
data storage
•	 
block storage
(Correct)
•	 
cache
Explanation
Option 3 is the correct answer.
Databases require persistent storage on block devices. Object storage does not provide data block or file system storage.
Data storage is not a type of storage system. Caching is commonly used with databases to improve read performance. However, caches are volatile and not suitable for persistent storage of data files.
Question 7: 
Skipped
A user wants a service that requires minimal setup.
Why would you recommend Cloud Storage, App Engine, and Cloud Functions to this user here?
•	 
only charged by time
•	 
because it is serverless
(Correct)
•	 
because the user needs to configure the virtual machine
•	 
It can only run applications written in Go.
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer.
All three services are serverless, so users don't need to configure virtual machines. Cloud Storage charges based on the time and size of data stored. App Engine Standard and Cloud Functions are not limited to Go language only.
Question 8: 
Skipped
You are deploying an API on the public internet and are concerned that your service will be the target of a DDoS attack. What Google Cloud services should you consider when securing my APIs?
•

Cloud IAM
•	 
VPCs
Explanation
Option 1 is the correct answer.
Cloud Armor is built on top of Google Cloud's load balancing service to allow or restrict access based on IP address, deploy rules to combat cross-site scripting attacks, and protect against SQL injection attacks. or provide

Option 2 is incorrect. Cloud CDN is a content distribution service, not a security service.

Option 3 is incorrect. Identity Access Management is a security service, but it is an authentication and authorization service, not a denial of service attack mitigation.

Option 4 is incorrect. Virtual Private Clouds are used to restrict network access to organizational resources, but do not have features to mitigate denial of service attacks.
Question 9: 
Skipped
Which specialized services are likely to be used to build data warehousing platforms that require complex extraction, transformation, and loading operations on batch data as well as processing streaming data?
•	 
Apigee API platform
•	 
data analysis
(Correct)
•	 
AI and machine learning
•	 
Cloud SDK
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer.
Dedicated services for data analytics include products that help extract, transform, load (ETL) and work with both batch and streaming data.
The Apigee API Platform is used to manage APIs and does not address the needs described.

AI and machine learning are useful for analyzing data in data warehouses, but that set of services is not necessarily useful for ETL operations.

The Cloud SDK is used to control the service, but by itself cannot directly perform the required operations.
Question 10: 
Skipped
A software engineer came to you for advice. The software engineer implemented a machine learning algorithm to identify cancer cells in medical images, but the algorithm is computationally intensive, performing many mathematical calculations and requiring immediate access to large amounts of data. and cannot be easily distributed across multiple servers. What kind of Compute Engine configuration would you recommend in this case?
•	 
High memory, high CPU instance
•	 
High memory, high CPU, GPU instances
(Correct)
•	 
Mid-level memory, high CPU instances
•	 
High CPU, GPU instances
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer.
Applications that are computationally intensive require high CPU power, but the fact that they are computationally intensive indicates that GPUs should be used.
You could consider running it in a cluster, but it's not easy to distribute the work across multiple servers. For this reason, you need one server that can handle the load. High-memory machine types are recommended for immediate access to large amounts of data.
Question 11: 
Skipped
You need to map your on-premises application's authentication and authorization policies to GCP's authentication and authorization mechanisms.
GCP's documentation states that identities must be authenticated in order to be authorized.
What do you mean by ID here?
•	 
Virtual machine ID
•	 
user
(Correct)
•	 
role
•	 
set of permissions
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer.
An identity is an abstraction of a user. Identity also characterizes processes that run on behalf of humans or virtual machines in GCP.

ID is not related to virtual machine ID. A role is a collection of privileges that can be granted to an identity.

Option 3 is incorrect. Logging is a log management service.
Question 15: 
Skipped
You are designing a cloud application for a healthcare provider. A records management application manages patient medical information.
Only a small percentage of employees have access to this data.
Applications used by the billing department include insurance and payment information. Another group of employees access billing information. In addition, the claims system has two components: the private claims system and the government claims system for public insurance.
Government regulations require software used for public insurance claims to be separate from other software systems. Which of the resource tiers listed below can meet these requirements and provide flexibility as requirements change?
•	 
One organization with folders for records management and billing. Claims folders include folders for private insurance companies and public insurance by the government. Common restrictions are specified in organization-level policies, and other policies are defined in appropriate folders.
(Correct)
•	 
One folder for records management, one folder for billing, and no organizational folders. Define policies at the folder level.
•	 
One organization under the organization with a folder for records management, a folder for private insurance companies, and a folder for public insurance by the government. All restrictions are specified in an organization-level policy, and policy restrictions are set the same for every folder.
•	 
none of the above
Explanation
Option 1 is the correct answer.
You can separate the two main applications into their own folders, and separate individual insurance and government payers in separate folders. This helps meet regulatory requirements to separate government payment software from other software.

Option 2 is incorrect. Option 2 does not include organizations. This is the root of the resource hierarchy.

Option 3 is less flexible in terms of different constraints for different applications.

A large company plans to use GCP in many departments. Each department is independently managed and has its own budget. Most departments will spend tens of thousands of dollars a month. How would you recommend setting up a billing account in this case?
•	 
Use a single self-service account
•	 
Use multiple self-service accounts
•	 
Use a single billing account
•	 
Use multiple billing accounts
(Correct)
Explanation
Option 4 is the correct answer.
Larger companies should use billing accounts when high charges are incurred. Self-service accounts are suitable only for amounts within your credit card allowance. Subdivisions are managed independently and have their own budgets, so each should have its own billing account.
Question 21:

You work for a retailer with many physical stores. Every night, the store uploads daily sales data.
Your task is to create a service that verifies uploads every night. You have decided to use a service account. Your boss has raised questions about the security of your proposed solution, specifically the authentication of service accounts, and you've been asked to explain the authentication mechanism used by service accounts. What is the authentication mechanism used by the service account?
•	 
Username and password
•	 
Two-factor authentication
•	 
encryption key
(Correct)
•	 
biometric authentication
Explanation
Option 3 is the correct answer.
When a service account is created, Google will generate a key for encrypted authentication. Username and password are not options for service accounts. Two-factor authentication is an authentication method that requires two authentication factors, a username/password combination and a code from an authentication device. Biometrics cannot be used with the service and is not an option.

Your manager is concerned about the fees your department is spending on cloud services. So you suggested that the team use preemptible VMs with one exception. Which of the following is "one thing" here?
•	 
database server
(Correct)
•	 
Batch processing without fixed time requirements for completion
•	 
High Performance Computing Cluster
•	 
none of the above
Explanation
Option 1 is the correct answer.
Database servers require high availability to respond to queries from users or applications. Preemptible machines are guaranteed to shut down within 24 hours.

Option 2 is incorrect. Batch processing jobs without fixed time requirements can use preemptible machines as long as the virtual machine is restarted.

Option 3 is incorrect. High performance computing clusters can use preemptible machines. This is because when a server is shut down, work on preemptible machines can be automatically scheduled to another node in the cluster.

Open Open Cloud Shell
•	 
Make sure you can access the virtual machine with SSH
•	 
Make sure the selected project is the one you want to work on
(Correct)
•	 
Check the list of running virtual machines
Explanation
Option 3 is the correct answer.
You need to confirm the selected project. All operations that you perform apply to resources in the selected project. Option 3 is the correct answer.
If you don't work at the command line, you don't need to open Cloud Shell. If it does open, you first need to make sure the project is correctly selected. To log in to your virtual machine using SSH, you must be working in the correct project. Therefore, you should check your project before logging in via SSH. The list of virtual machines in the VM Instance window is the list of virtual machines for the current project.
Question 34:

•	 
Create a script that changes the configuration using the gcloud command and store the script in your version control system
(Correct)
•	 
Create a note when changing configurations and save it to Google Drive
•	 
Restrict permissions so that only you can make changes so you always know when and why a configuration was changed
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer.
The best of the four is to use versioned scripts. You can document the reason for the script change. Also, you can run the script repeatedly on different machines and implement the same changes. This reduces the chance of errors when entering commands manually.

Option 1 is incorrect. Doesn't improve documentation of change reasons.

Option 3 is incorrect. Documentation could be better, but an executable script accurately reflects what was done. Details may be missing in the memo.

Option 4 is incorrect. You can become a change bottleneck yourself. Without you, you cannot make changes, and human memory does not appear to be a reliable way to track all configuration changes.

An architect is migrating a legacy application to Google Cloud.
You want to manage the cluster as a single entity, while minimizing changes to the existing architecture. A legacy application is running in a load-balanced cluster running two differently configured nodes. A design decision made several years ago necessitates these two configurations.
Application load is more or less constant, so there is little need to scale up or down. Which GCP Compute Engine resource do you recommend using?
•	 
preemptible instance
•	 
Unmanaged instance group
(Correct)
•	 
managed instance group
•	 
GPUs
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer.
Unmanaged instance groups are for these limited use cases. Unmanaged instance groups are generally discouraged. Managed instance groups are the recommended way to use instance groups, but they cannot be used in two different configurations. Preemptible instances and GPUs are irrelevant in this scenario.

You are deploying a highly available application on Kubernetes Engine.
You want to maintain availability even in the event of a major network outage in our data center.
What features of Kubernetes Engine can you use?
•	 
multiple instance groups
•	 
Multizone/regional cluster
(Correct)
•	 
Regional deployment
•	 
load distribution
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer.
Kubernetes Engine allows multi-zone/multi-region clusters. These clusters are used to increase application resilience. So option 2 is the correct answer.

Option 1 refers to Instance Groups, a feature of Compute Engine. It's not a feature of Kubernetes Engine.

Option 3 is incorrect. Regional deployment is the wrong term. Load balancing is part of Kubernetes' default ability to distribute loads.

Option 4 is incorrect. A data center cannot achieve resiliency if the load is not balanced across zones or regions.

•	 
Kubernetes API
(Correct)
•	 
StatefulSet
•	 
Cloud SDK gcloud command
•	 
Replica Sets
Explanation
Option 1 is the correct answer.
All interaction with the cluster is done through the master using the Kubernetes API.
Commands are issued by the cluster master when an action is performed on a node.

Options 2 and 4 are incorrect. These are the controllers in the cluster and do not affect how commands are received from client devices.

Option 3 is incorrect. kubectl is used to initiate the deployment, not gcloud.
Question 53: 
Skipped
You tried using the kubect command for the first time and got an error message saying that the resource could not be found or could not connect to the cluster. What command can you use to resolve the error?

gcloud container clusters access
•	 
gdcloud container clusters get-credentials
(Correct)
•	 
gcloud auth container
•	 
gcloud auth container clusters
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer.
You probably don't have access to the cluster. The gcloud container clusters get credentials command is the correct command to configure kubectl to use GCP credentials on your cluster. Anything else is an invalid command.

A team is setting up a web service for internal use. We are considering using the same IP address for the foreseeable future. What kind of IP address will you assign?
•	 
internal
•	 
external
•	 
static
(Correct)
•	 
Ephemeral
Explanation
Option 3 is the correct answer.
A static address is assigned until it is freed. Option 3 is the correct answer.

Option 1 and option 2 are incorrect. The inside and outside addresses determine whether traffic is routed inside or outside the subnet. External addresses can reach traffic from the Internet. Internal addresses cannot.

Option 4 is incorrect. Ephemeral addresses are released when the virtual machine is shut down or deleted.
Question 62: 
Skipped
You're about to fire up a virtual machine and experiment with the new Python data science library.
You plan to SSH into the virtual machine by entering the server name, run the Python interpreter interactively for a while, and then shut down the virtual machine.
What type of IP address will you assign to this virtual machine?
•	 
Ephemeral
(Correct)
•	 
static
•	 
forever
•	 
IPv8
Explanation
Option 1 is the correct answer.
Ephemeral addresses are sufficient. This is because resources outside the subnet don't need to reach the virtual machine and can SSH into the virtual machine from the console. So option 1 is the correct answer.

Option 2 is incorrect. There is no need to allocate static addresses that need to be freed.

Option 3 is incorrect. There is no permanent type.

Option 4 is incorrect. No IPv8 address.
Question 63: 
Skipped
You created a subnet sn1 with 192,168.0.0 with 65,534 available IP addresses. However, it turns out that we don't need that many addresses, so we want to reduce the number to 254. Which command should you use?
•	 
gcloud compute networks subnets expand-ip-range sn1 --prefix-length=24
•	 
gcloud compute networks subnets expand-ip-range sn1 --prefix-length=-8
•	 
gcloud compute networks subnets expand-ip-range 511 --size=256
•	 
No command to reduce the number of available IP addresses
(Correct)
Explanation
Option 4 is the correct answer.
You cannot use commands to decrease the number of addresses.

Option 1 is incorrect. The prefix length specified in the expand-ip-range command must be a number less than the current length. If there are 65,534 addresses, the prefix length is 16.

Option 2 is also incorrect for the same reason. The prefix cannot be negative.

Also option 3 is incorrect. There is no --size parameter.
Question 64: 
Skipped
You created a subnet sn using 192.168.0.0 .
You would like to allocate 14 IP addresses. What prefix length should you use?
•	 
32
•	 
28
(Correct)
•	 
20
•	 
16
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer.
The prefix length specifies the length in bits of the subnet mask. The remaining bits of the IP address are used in the device address. Since IP addresses are 32 bits, reduce the mask length to get the number of bits to represent the address. 16 is 2 to the power of 4, so 4 bits are required to represent 14 addresses. 32 - 4 is 28. So option 2 is the correct answer.

Option 1 has 1 address available, Option 3 has 4,094 addresses, and Option 4 has 65,534 addresses.

You host a website on a Compute Engine virtual machine. Users can access your website using the domain name you provide. You stopped and restarted the virtual machine to perform maintenance work on it.
The user can no longer access the website. Nothing else has changed in the subnet. What could be the cause of this issue?
•	 
Reboot changed DNS records
•	 
Using an ephemeral IP address instead of a static IP address
(Correct)
•	 
Not enough addresses available in subnet
•	 
Subnet changed
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer.
Stopping and restarting the virtual machine releases the ephemeral IP address. With a static IP address, the same address will be used across reboots.

Option 1 is incorrect. Rebooting the virtual machine does not change the DNS records.

Option 3 is incorrect. If the virtual machine had enough addresses to get one when it first started, and later released the IP address, there should be one or more IP addresses, and the other devices not added to the subnet.

Option 4 is incorrect. No other changes, including subnet changes, are made.

•	 
Create a group for auditors and assign roles/viewer to them.
•	 
Create a group for auditors, and assign roles/bigquery.dataViewer to them.
(Correct)
•	 
Assign a custom role to each auditor that allows view-only access to BigQuery.
Explanation
Option3 is correct because it uses a predefined role to provide view access to BigQuery for the group of auditors. Auditors can be added or deleted from the group if job responsibilities change.

Option1 is not correct because Google recommended practice is to assign IAM roles to groups, not individuals. Groups are easier to manage than individual users and they provide high level visibility into roles and permissions.

Option2 is not correct because it uses a basic role to give auditors view access to all resources on the project.

Option4 is not correct because using a predefined role can accomplish the goal and requires less maintenance.

Your application needs to process a significant rate of transactions. The rate of transactions exceeds the processing capabilities of a single virtual machine (VM).
You want to spread transactions across multiple servers in real time and in the most cost-effective manner. you do?
•	 
Send transactions to BigQuery. On the VMs, poll for transactions that do not have the ‘processed’ key, and mark them ‘processed’ when done.
•	 
Set up Cloud SQL with a memory cache for speed. On your multiple servers, poll for transactions that do not have the ‘processed’ key, and mark them ‘processed’ when done.
•	 
Send transactions to Pub/Sub. Process them in VMs in a managed instance group.
(Correct)
•	 
Record transactions in Cloud Bigtable, and poll for new transactions from the VMs.
Explanation
Option3 is correct because Pub/Sub is a scalable solution that can effectively distribute a large number of tasks among multiple servers at a low cost.

Option1 is not correct because its latency is significantly higher than the real-time response required.

Option2 is not correct because it will not deliver the desired performance.

What is the basic unit of computing in cloud computing?
•	 
physical server
•	 
virtual machine
(Correct)
•	 
block
•	 
subnet
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer.
The basic unit for purchasing computing resources is a virtual machine (VM).

Option 1 is incorrect. A physical server is the foundation of a virtual machine, but the physical server's resources are allocated to the virtual machine.

Options 3 and 4 are incorrect. Blocks and subnets are not related to basic units of computing.
Question 102: 
Skipped
You were asked to design a storage system for a web application that allows users to upload large data files and analyze them using business intelligence workflows.
Files should be stored on a highly available storage system. No file system functionality is required. Which storage system should you use on Google Cloud Platform in this case?
•	 
block storage
•	 
object storage
(Correct)
•	 
cache
•	 
Network File System
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer.
Object storage such as Cloud Storage has no limit on the amount of data that can be stored, and objects can be stored redundantly.

Option 1 is incorrect. You can also use block storage, but you'll need to manage replication yourself to ensure high availability.

Option 3 is incorrect. A cache is temporary in-memory storage, not a highly available persistent storage system.

Option 4 is incorrect. 4 is not a good option as file system functionality is not required.
Question 103: 
Skipped
You have been asked to set up network security on Virtual Private Cloud.
Your company has multiple subnetworks and would like to limit traffic between these subnetworks.
What network security controls should you use to control the flow of traffic between subnets?
•	 
Identity access management
•	 
router
•	 
firewall
(Correct)
•	 
IP address table
Explanation
Option 3 is the correct answer.
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) firewalls restrict the flow of traffic into and out of a network or subnetwork with software-defined network controls. So Option 3 is the correct answer.

Routers are used to route traffic to its correct destination on the network.

Identity Access Management is used to authenticate and authorize users. It is not relevant for network control between sub-networks.

The IP Address Table is not a security control.
Question 104: 
Skipped
In which of the following situations is it appropriate to invest in a server for the long term, such as committing to use the server for 3-5 years?
•	 
If you are about to start a company
•	 
If the company can accurately predict server needs over time
(Correct)
•	 
If your company has a fixed IT budget
•	 
If your company's IT budget is not fixed
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer.
Investing in servers pays off when you can accurately predict how many servers and other equipment you will need over time, and if you can continue to use that equipment. Startups are not established businesses with a proven track record of predicting needs in the next 3-5 years. It doesn't matter if your budget is fixed or variable. Server investments should be based on server capacity demand.

•	 
1
•	 
10
•	 
25
•	 
Cloud Vision is a serverless service so you don't need it
(Correct)
Explanation
Option 4 is the correct answer.
Cloud Vision is one of Google Cloud's dedicated services. Users of the service do not need to configure their virtual machines to use the service.
Question 106: 
Skipped
Many services need to be running to support the application.
Which of the following is the preferred deployment model in this case?
•	 
Run in one large virtual machine
•	 
Using containers in managed clusters
(Correct)
•	 
Use two large virtual machines, one read-only
•	 
Use small virtual machines for all services and increase virtual machine size if CPU utilization is above 90%
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer.
Containers are the most flexible and efficient way to use your cluster's resources. Option 2 is the correct answer because the orchestration platform can reduce the operational load.

Running in a single cluster is not recommended as all services will stop if a server fails. Having two virtual machines doesn't help if one is read-only.

A read-only server may work with databases, but the question doesn't mention databases.

You should avoid using small virtual machines and upgrading them when the workload is overwhelmed, as this will degrade service quality.
Question 107: 
Skipped
When setting up a network on Google Cloud Platform, what are the network's resources in Google Cloud Platform?
•	 
Virtual Private Clouds
(Correct)
•	 
sub domain
•	 
cluster
•	 
none of the above
Explanation
Option 1 is the correct answer.
When creating a network, it is treated as a Virtual Private Cloud. Resources are added to your VPC. No access outside the VPC unless explicitly configured.
A subdomain is associated with a web domain and not with a Google Cloud network configuration. Clusters such as Kubernetes clusters can belong to your network, but they are not network resources.
Question 108: 
Skipped
You plan to deploy a SaaS application for users in North America, Europe, and Asia. To maintain scalability, the workload should be distributed across servers in multiple regions.
Which Google Cloud service should you use to distribute my workload?
•	 
Cloud DNS
•	 
Cloud Spanner
•	 
Cloud Load Balancing
(Correct)
•	 
Cloud CDN
Explanation
Option 3 is the correct answer.
Cloud load Balancing distributes workloads within and across regions, performs health checks, and performs autoscaling.

Option 1 is incorrect. Cloud DNS provides domain name services such as translating URLs such as www.example.com into IP addresses.

Option 2 is incorrect. Cloud Spanner is a distributed relational database, but does not perform workload distribution.

Option 4 is incorrect. Cloud CDN distributes your content across regions and reduces latency when delivering content to users around the world.
Question 109: 
Skipped
You have an application that uses Pub/Sub message queues to maintain a list of tasks to be processed by another application.
Applications that process messages from Pub/Sub queues only remove the messages after the task is complete. It takes about 10 seconds to complete the task.
It doesn't matter if two or more virtual machines perform the same task. What would be a cost-effective configuration to handle this workload?
•	 
Use preemptible virtual machines
(Correct)
•	 
Use a standard virtual machine
•	 
Use Cloud Dataproc
•	 
Using Cloud Spanner
Explanation
Option 1 is the correct answer.
This is a good use case for preemptible virtual machines. Preemptible virtual machines reduce the cost of running a second application without losing work. If a preemptible virtual machine is shut down before the task completes, the task is removed from the queue only after the task completes so that another virtual machine can run the task. Also, it doesn't matter how many times a task is run, so even if two virtual machines run the same task, it won't adversely affect the output of the application. Neither DataProc nor Spanner are suitable products for this task.

•	 
Cloud Firestore
(Correct)
•	 
Cloud Spanner
•	 
Cloud Datastore
•	 
Cloud SQL
Explanation
Option 1 is the correct answer.
Cloud Firestore is a mobile database service that allows you to synchronize data between mobile devices and centralized storage.

Option 2 is incorrect. Spanner is a global relational database, intended for large-scale applications that require transaction support in a highly scaled database.

Options 3 and 4 are incorrect. Datastore and Cloud SQL can also be used, but custom development is required to synchronize data between mobile devices and centralized data stores.
Question 113:

•	 
Cloud SQL
•	 
Cloud Spanner
(Correct)
•	 
Cloud Datastore
•	 
Cloud Bigtable
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer.
Spanner supports ANSE 2011 standard SQL and global transactions. Cloud SQL supports standard SQL, but without global transactions. Datastore and Bigtable are NoSQL databases.

•	 
App Engine flexible environment
•	 
Cloud Engine
•	 
App Engine standard environment
(Correct)
•	 
Kubernetes Engine
Explanation
Option 3 is the correct answer.
App Engine standard environment provides an automatically scaling serverless Python sandbox. App Engine flexible environment runs containers and requires a lot of configuration. Cloud Engine and Kubernetes Engine require considerable management and monitoring.

Which service manages container images?
•	 
Kubernetes Engine
•	 
Compute Engine
•	 
Container Registry
(Correct)
•	 
Container Engine
Explanation
Option 3 is the correct answer.
Container Registry is a service for managing images that can be used by other services. This includes Kubernetes Engine and Compute Engine. So option 3 is the correct answer.

Both Compute Engine and Kubernetes Engine use images, but do not manage them. There is no service called Container Engine.
Question 117:

•	 
kubectl list container images
•	 
kubectl container list images
Explanation
Option 1 is the correct answer.
Images are managed by GCP, so the correct command is gcloud .
Option 2 is incorrect. Because the verb comes before the resource.

Options 3 and 4 are incorrect. kubectl manages Kubernetes resources, not GCP resources such as container images.
Question 118: 
Skipped
You have now created a deployment. You would like to allow applications outside the cluster to access the services provided by the deployment. What should You do with the service?
•	 
Assign a public IP address
•	 
Issue the kubectl expose deployment command
(Correct)
•	 
Issue the gcloud expose deployment command
•	 
do nothing. Must be accessible at cluster level
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer.
The kubectl expose deployment command makes the service accessible.

Option 1 is incorrect. IP addresses are assigned to virtual machines, not services. The command gcloud does not manage Kubernetes services.

Options 3 and 4 are incorrect. Making services accessible is not a cluster-level task.
Question 119: 
Skipped
You have deployed your application to a Kubernetes cluster. This cluster processes sensor data from delivery vehicles. The amount of data received depends on the number of vehicles making the delivery.

You've been asked to deploy a Cloud Function that changes the format of an image file as soon as it's uploaded to Cloud Storage.
After a few hours, you noticed that about 10% of files were not processed correctly. After reviewing the failed files, you found that they were all significantly larger than average. What causes this error?
•	 
Syntax error in function code
•	 
Incorrect runtime selected
•	 
Timeout too short, not enough time to process large files
(Correct)
•	 
You're getting a permissions error on the Cloud Storage bucket that contains your files
Explanation
Option 3 is the correct answer.
If the timeout period is too short, fewer files will be processed in time and large files will not be processed. If only 10% of the files are failing, it's not a syntax error or a bad runtime choice like option 1 or option 2. Such errors affect all files, not just large files. Similarly, if there is a permission issue with your Cloud Storage bucket, it will affect all your files.

The company you work for is releasing a new online service based on a new user interface experience driven by a set of services running on a server.
There is a separate set of services that manage authentication and authorization.
The service's datastore set tracks account information. All three sets of services must be highly reliable and scale to meet demand. Which Google Cloud service would be best for deploying this?
•	 
App Engine standard environment
•	 
Compute Engine
•	 
Cloud Functions
•	 
Kubernetes Engine
(Correct)
Explanation
Option 4 is the correct answer.
The descriptive scenario is perfect for Kubernetes. Each group of services is structured in pods and deployed using Kubernetes deployment.
Kubernetes Engine manages node health, load balancing, and scaling. App Engine standard edition has language-specific sandboxes, but they are not suitable for this use case. Cloud Functions are designed for short-running event processing. It is not the continuous processing required in this scenario. Compute Engine can meet the requirements of this use case, but requires additional effort on the part of application administrators and dev ops to configure load balancers, monitor health, and manage software deployments.
Question 161:

A mobile application uploads images for analysis, such as identifying objects in images and extracting text that may be embedded in images.
A third party created a mobile application and you developed an image analysis service. This third party and you have both agreed to use Cloud Storage for image storage.
You want to keep the two services completely separate, but you need a way to trigger image analysis as soon as an image is uploaded. What should you do in this case?
•	 
Run the image analysis service in a VM, modify the mobile app to start the VM running the image analysis service, and configure that VM to copy files from storage to the VM's local storage.
•	 
Write a function in Python that Cloud Functions will call when a new image file is written to the Cloud Storage bucket that receives the new image. This function should send the URL of the uploaded file to the image analysis service. The image analysis service then loads the images from Cloud Storage, performs the analysis to produce results, and saves the results to Cloud Storage
(Correct)
•	 
Run a Kubernetes cluster continuously, dedicating one pod to listing the contents of the upload bucket and discovering new files in Cloud Storage, and another pod dedicated to running image analysis software.
•	 
Run a Compute Engine VM to continuously list the contents of your Cloud Storage upload bucket to discover new files. Continuously run the image analysis service in another VM.
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer.
This is a perfect use case for Cloud Functions. Cloud Functions are triggered on file upload events. Cloud Functions call the image processing service. In this setup the two services are independent. No additional server required. A does not meet the requirement to maintain service independence.

Options 3 and 4 have a higher administrative burden and probably higher operating costs than option 2.

Management is considering three different cloud providers.
You have been tasked with compiling billing and cost information so that management can compare cost structures across clouds. Which of the following describes the cost of virtual machines on GCP?
•	 
Virtual machines are billed in 1-second increments. The cost depends on the number of CPUs and amount of memory in the machine type. You can create custom machine types. Preemptible virtual machines cost up to 80% less than standard virtual machines. For sustained use, Google will apply a discount.
(Correct)
•	 
Virtual machines are billed by the second. Also, a virtual machine can run for up to 24 hours before being shut down.
•	 
In some regions only, Google applies sustained use discounts. Virtual machine costs vary depending on the number of CPUs and amount of memory in the machine type. You can create custom machine types. Preemptible virtual machines cost up to 80% less than standard virtual machines.
•	 
The minimum charge for a virtual machine is an hourly usage charge. Also, the cost depends on the number of CPUs and amount of memory in the machine type.
Explanation
All statements in option 1 are correct and related to billing and costs.

Option 2 is correct in that virtual machines are billed per second, but it is incorrect because preemptible virtual machines are shut down within 24 hours of booting.

Option 3 is incorrect. Discounts are not restricted to some regions.

What are the conditions under which an instance group scales autoscaling?
•	 
CPU usage and operating system updates
•	 
Disk usage and CPU usage only
•	 
Network latency, load balancing ability, CPU utilization
(Correct)
•	 
Disk usage and operating system updates only
Explanation
Option 3 is the correct answer.
You can set autoscaling policies to add or remove instances based on CPU utilization, monitoring metrics, load balancing capacity, and queue-based workloads. Scaling can be triggered when monitoring metrics are configured for disk, network latency, and memory resources.
Question 180:

A new engineer looks at the best cases to use Kubernetes and the best cases to use instance groups.
You pointed out that Kubernetes uses instance groups.
What role do instance groups play in a Kubernetes cluster?
•	 
Monitor instance health
•	 
Create a pod and deployment
•	 
Create a collection of virtual machines that can be managed as a unit
(Correct)
•	 
Create a notification channel for alerts
Explanation
Option 3 is the correct answer.
In Kubernetes, the instance group is created as part of the process of creating the cluster, so option 3 is correct. Stackdriver, not instance groups, is used to monitor node health and create alerts and notifications.
Kubernetes creates pods and deployments, which are not served by instance groups.
Question 181: 
Skipped
You have developed an application that calls a service running in a Kubernetes cluster.
Services run in pods and can be terminated and replaced by other pods if the pod is unhealthy. At that time, different IP addresses may be assigned.
How should you code my application to ensure that it works in this situation?
•	 
Query Kubernetes for a list of IP addresses of pods running services you want to use
•	 
Communicate with Kubernetes services so that applications do not need to work with specific pods.
(Correct)
•	 
Query Kubernetes for a list of pods running the service you want to use
•	 
Get the desired IP address using the gcloud command
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer.
A service is an application that provides an API endpoint that allows applications to discover the pods running a particular application.

For options 1 and 3, coding against the API to manage the cluster is more code than working with the service, and many API functions need to be changed. Option 4 is incorrect.
Question 182: 
Skipped
You want to create a script to deploy a Kubernetes cluster containing GPUs.
You have deployed a cluster before and am not familiar with some of the required parameters. You should deploy this script as soon as possible. Which of the following could be used as one way to rapidly develop this script?
•	 
Use the GPU template in Kubernetes Engine's Cloud Console to generate gcloud commands to create a cluster
(Correct)
•	 
Search the web for scripts
•	 
Check the documentation for gcloud parameters for adding GPUs
•	 
Use an existing script to add parameters for connecting GPUs
Explanation
Option 1 is the correct answer.
The most reliable method is to start with an existing template, fill in the parameters, and generate the gcloud command.

Option 4 is also possible, but multiple parameters required by the configuration may not be present in the starting script. This method may require some trial and error.

Option 2 and Option 3 are also possible, but may take longer to complete.

Question 186: 
Skipped
A deployment team needs to be notified when an application running on some Kubernetes cluster is experiencing issues.
Another team member wants another way to be notified besides Stackdriver alerts.
What's the most efficient way to send notifications and fulfill team requests?
•	 
Configure SMS text message, Slack, and email notifications for alerts
(Correct)
•	 
Create separate alerts for each notification channel
•	 
Create email notification alerts and have these notification emails forwarded to other notification systems
•	 
Use a single third-party notification mechanism
Explanation
Option 1 is the correct answer.
Alerts can have multiple channels. Option 1 is the correct answer.

Channels include email, webhooks, SMS text messages, and third-party tools such as PagerDuty, Campfire, and Siack. No need for multiple alerts for individual notifications.

Option 3 is ad-hoc and incurs additional maintenance burden.

Option 4 does not meet your requirements.
Question 187: 
Skipped
You have deployed your application to a Kubernetes cluster. You notice that multiple pods have been starving for resources for a period of time, causing pods to die.
When resources are available, these newly instantiated pods are created.
Even though the new pod's IP address is different from the terminated pod's IP address, the client is still able to connect to the pod. Which Kubernetes component makes this possible?
•	 
Service
(Correct)
•	 
ReplicaSet
•	 
Alert
•	 
StatefulSet
Explanation
Option 1 is the correct answer.
Services provide some level of indirect access to Pods. Pods are ephemeral. The client connects to a service that can discover pods. ReplicaSets and StatefulSets provide managed pods. Alerts are for reporting the state of resources.

Question 194: 
Skipped
Developed a microservice ready for production. Before deploying, you need to know how to manage the service lifecycle.
Architects are specifically looking for ways to deploy service updates with minimal service disruption.
What elements of App Engine components can be used during service updates to minimize service disruption?
•	 
service
•	 
version
(Correct)
•	 
instance group
•	 
instance
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer.
Version supports migration. An app can contain multiple versions. You can migrate traffic to the new version by deploying with the --migrate parameter. So option 2 is the correct answer.

Options 1 and 4 are incorrect. A service is a higher level abstraction that represents the functionality of a microservice. An application has multiple services, but they serve different purposes. You can add and remove instances as needed, but they will only run one version of a service.

Option 3 is incorrect. Instance groups are part of Compute Engine, not an App Engine component.
Question 195: 
Skipped
You have released an application that runs on App Engine Standard. Demand has peaks and you need up to 12 instances at peak times.
However, 5 instances is sufficient for most other situations.
What's the best way to ensure you have enough instances to meet demand without overpaying?
•	 
Configure autoscaling for your app, specifying a maximum of 12 instances and a minimum of 5 instances
(Correct)
•	 
Configure basic scaling for your app, specifying a maximum of 12 instances and a minimum of 5 instances
•	 
Just before the peak period, create a cron job to add the instances. Terminate instances after the peak period ends
•	 
Configure app instance detection and do not specify maximum or minimum number of instances
Explanation
Option 1 is the correct answer.
Autoscaling allows you to set maximum and minimum number of instances. So option 1 is the correct answer.

Option 2 is incorrect. Basic scaling does not support maximum and minimum instance counts.

Option 3 is not recommended because peak loads are difficult to predict and even if schedules are predictable today, they may change over time.

Option 4 is incorrect. There is no instance detection option.
Question 196: 
Skipped
Which component is the lowest in the hierarchy of App Engine components?
•	 
application
•	 
instance
(Correct)
•	 
version
•	 
service
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer.
Instances are the lowest level components.

So option 2 is the correct answer. An application has one or more services. A service has one or more versions. A version runs on one or more instances when the application is running.
Question 197: 
Skipped
You plan to deploy multiple App Engine applications from your project. What did this plan fail to consider?
•	 
App Engine only supports one application per project
(Correct)
•	 
App Engine only supports two applications per project
•	 
App Engine application exists outside the project
•	 
none. this is a common pattern
Explanation
Option 1 is the correct answer.
A project can only support one App Engine app. So option 1 is the correct answer. If you want to run other applications, you have to put them in each project.
Question 198: 
Skipped
Which parameters can be configured for basic scaling?
•	 
max_instances and min_instances
•	 
idle_timeout and min_instances
•	 
idle_timeout and max_instances
(Correct)
•	 
idle_timeout and target_throughput_utilization
Explanation
Option 3 is the correct answer.
Basic scaling only allows you to specify idle time and maximum number of instances. So option 3 is the correct answer.

min_instances is not supported. target_throughput_utilization is an autoscaling parameter, not a base scaling parameter.
Question 199: 
Skipped
What is the runtime parameter in app.yaml used to specify?
•	 
script to run
•	 
URL to access the application
•	 
language runtime environment
(Correct)
•	 
Maximum time the application can run
Explanation
Option 3 is the correct answer.
The runtime parameter specifies the language environment in which to run. So option 3 is the correct answer.
The script to run is specified in the script parameter. The URL to access the application is based on the project name and domain appspot.com. There is no parameter that specifies the maximum time the application can run.
Question 200: 
Skipped
A team of developers has created an optimized version of the service. It runs 30% faster than before in most cases. The developer team wants to roll it out to all users right away, but you think you'll have to release large-scale changes over time in case there are major bugs.

Question 204: 
Skipped
A product manager is proposing a new application. This application requires multiple backend services, three business logic services, and access to a relational database.
Each service provides a single function, and multiple of these services are required to complete a business task. Service execution time depends on the size of the input and is expected to take up to 30 minutes in some cases. Which Google Cloud product is the best serverless option for running this intertwined service?
•	 
Cloud Functions
•	 
Compute Engine
•	 
App Engine
(Correct)
•	 
Cloud Storage
Explanation
Option 3 is the correct answer.
App Engine is designed to support the tightly coupled services that make up your application. This is different from Cloud Functions.
Cloud Functions support single-purpose functions that operate independently in response to isolated events in the Google Cloud and are designed to complete within a specified time period.
Compute Engine is not a serverless option.
Cloud Storage is not a computing product.
Question 205:

All of the following items generate events that can be triggered using Cloud Functions.
However, there is one exception. which one.
•	 
Cloud Storage
•	 
Cloud Pub/Sub
•	 
SSL
(Correct)
•	 
Firebase
Explanation
Option 3 is the correct answer.
SSL is a secure protocol for accessing servers remotely. For example, it is used to access Compute Engine instances. It is not an event that can be triggered using Cloud Functions. Three other GCP products to choose from generate events with associated triggers.
Question 206: 
Skipped
You are designing a function to run on Cloud Functions.
The amount of memory required by this function exceeds the default amount of memory. Also, the function should only be applied when the finalize event occurs after the file has been uploaded to Cloud Storage.
Additionally, the function only applies logic to files of the standard image file type.
Which of the following required features cannot be specified in parameters and must be implemented in the function code?
•	 
Cloud Functions name
•	 
memory allocated to the function
•	 
File types to apply to the function
(Correct)
•	 
event type
Explanation
Option 3 is the correct answer.
There is no option to specify which file types the function applies to. However, you can specify the packets to which the function applies.
You can only store files or types that you work with in that bucket. Alternatively, the function can check the file type and then, depending on the type, decide whether or not to execute the rest of the function. All other choices are parameters of the Cloud Storage function.
Question 207: 
Skipped
What is the default timeout period for Cloud Functions to run?
•	 
30 seconds
•	 
1 minute
(Correct)
•

•	 
google.storage.object.finalize
(Correct)
•	 
google.storage.object.upload
•	 
google.storage.object.archive
•	 
google.storage.object.metadataUpdate
Explanation
Option 1 is the correct answer.
The correct trigger is google.storage.object.finatize which is triggered when a file is uploaded
will be executed later.

Option 2 is incorrect. Not a valid trigger name.

Option 3 is incorrect. Triggers run when files are archived, not when they are uploaded.

Option 4 is incorrect. Triggers run when some metadata attribute changes, not just after a file upload.
Question 209: 
Skipped
You've been asked to deploy Cloud Functions to work with Cloud Pub/Sub.
While reviewing Python code, you noticed a reference to the Python function base64.b64decode.
Why do Pub/Sub Cloud Functions need the decode function?
•	 
Shouldn't be in a function, because it's not needed
•	 
Pub/Sub topic messages are encoded so that binary data can be used where text data is expected. A message must be decoded to be able to access the data in that message
(Correct)
•	 
A padding character should be added to the end of the message to make all messages the same length
•	 
The decode function maps data from the dictionary data structure to the list data structure
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer.
Messages are stored in text format base64 so that binary data can be stored in text format in messages.

Option 1 is incorrect. You need to map from binary encoding to standard text encoding.

Option 3 is incorrect. The function does not pad the blanks with additional characters or justify the length.

Option 4 is incorrect. Dictionary data types are not converted to list data types.
Question 210: 
Skipped
Your company has a web application that allows job seekers to upload resume files. Some of these files are Microsoft Word files, PDF files, text files, etc.
You want to save all your resumes as PDFs. How can you get the fastest upload-to-conversion time and the least amount of coding effort?
•	 
Create an App Engine application with multiple services and convert all documents to PDF
•	 
Implement Cloud Functions in Cloud Storage that run on the finalize event. The function checks the file type and if it's not PDF, calls the PDF conversion function. Write the PDF version to the bucket with the original file
(Correct)
•	 
Add the names of all files to a Cloud Pub/Sub topic and periodically run a batch job that converts the original files to PDF
•	 
Implement Cloud Functions in Cloud Pub/Sub that run on the finalize event. The function checks the file type and if it's not PDF, calls the PDF conversion function. Write PDF version to bucket with original file
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer.
Optionally, use the Cloud Storage finalize event to trigger the conversion. The delay from the time the file is uploaded to the time the conversion is completed is minimal. Option 1 is also possible, but requires more coding than option 2.

Option 3 is not the best option as the files will not be converted until the batch job is run.

Option 4 is incorrect. You cannot use the finalize event to create Cloud Pub/Sub Cloud Functions. This event is for Cloud Storage, not Cloud Pub/Sub.
Question 211: 
Skipped
What types of triggers allow developers to invoke Cloud Functions using HTTP POST, GET, and PUT calls?
•	 
HTTP
(Correct)
•	 
Webhooks
•

Your manager has asked me for help in reducing my Cloud Storage charges. Some files stored in Cloud Storage are rarely accessed. What kind of storage would you recommend for such files?
•	 
Nearline
•	 
Regional
•	 
Coldline
(Correct)
•	 
Multi-Regional
Explanation
Option 3 is the correct answer.
Since your goal is to reduce costs, you should use the lowest cost storage option. Coldline has the lowest cost at $0.07 USD/GB per gigabyte per month, making option 3 the correct answer.

Nearline has the next lowest cost, followed by Regional. Multi-Regional has the highest price per gigabyte. Both Nearline and Coldline incur access charges, which are not taken into account in this issue.

You work for a start-up company that develops analytics software for IoT data.
You constantly need to ingest large amounts of data and store that data for months. Multiple applications need to see this data at this start-up company.
Data volumes are expected to grow to petabyte scale. Which database should you use?
•	 
Cloud Spanner
•	 
Bigtable
(Correct)
•	 
BigQuery
•	 
Datastore
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer.
Bigtable is a columnar database that can ingest large amounts of data in a consistent manner. So option 2 is the correct answer. It also delivers sub-millisecond latency and is a good option for supporting queries.
Cloud Spanner is a global relational database and is not suitable for fast ingestion of large amounts of data. Datastore is an object data model, not suitable for IoT or other time series data. BigQuery is an analytics database and is not intended for ingesting large amounts of data in a short period of time.

(Correct)
•	 
Operating system tuning for optimal Cloud SQL performance
Explanation
Option 3 is the correct answer.
Database creation is the responsibility of a Cloud SQL database administrator or other user. Google applies security patches and performs other maintenance.

Option 1 is incorrect. GCP performs regularly scheduled backups.

Option 2 is incorrect. Database administrators must schedule backups, but GCP ensures that backups run on schedule.

Option 4 is incorrect. Cloud SQL users cannot SSH into Cloud SQL servers, so operating system tuning is not possible. However, this is not a problem. Appropriately managed by Google.
Question 216:

Which is one of the direct advantages of using message queues in distributed systems?
•	 
Enhanced security
•	 
Separate services. So if one service is delayed, the others are not delayed.
(Correct)
•	 
More programming languages supported
•	 
Store messages until read by default
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer
Using message queues between services provides service isolation. Therefore, a delay in one service does not cause delays in other services. So option 2 is the correct answer.

Option 1 is incorrect. Adding Message Queuing does not directly mitigate security risks that can exist in distributed systems, such as overly lax permissions.

Option 3 is incorrect. Adding queues is not directly related to programming language.

Also option 4 is incorrect. By default, message queues have no retention period.

An application administrator is responsible for managing all resources within a project.
This application administrator wants to delegate some of the responsibilities of the service account to another administrator. If additional service accounts are created, other administrators will also need to manage them. What is the best way to delegate the permissions required to manage service accounts?
•	 
Grant iam.serviceAccountUser to administrators at the project level
(Correct)
•	 
Grant iam.serviceAccountUser to administrators at the service account level
•	 
Grant iam.serviceProjectAccountUser to administrators at the project level
•	 
Grant iam.serviceProjectAccountUser to administrators at the service account level
Explanation
Option 1 is the correct answer.
Granting iam.serviceAccountUser to a user at the project level allows that user to manage all service accounts in the project. When a new service account is created, it is automatically granted permission to manage service accounts. You can grant iam.serviceAccountUser to administrators at the service account level, but you must set the role for all service accounts. When a new service account is created, the account administrator must grant iam.serviceAccountUser to other administrators of the new service account.
iam.serviceProjectAccountuser is an incorrect role.

Your company is developing an image distribution application. This application stores and shares images in a Cloud Storage bucket called "test1".
Which command should you use to allow the image to be read by all users?
•	 
gsutil iam ch -d objectViewer: allUsers gs: // test1
•	 
gsutil iam ch -d allUsers: Viewer gs: // test1
•	 
gsutil iam ch allUsers: objectViewer gs: // test1
(Correct)
•	 
gcloud iam ch objectViewer: allUsers gs: // test1
(Incorrect)
Explanation
Option 3 is the correct answer. By running the'gsutil iam ch allUsers: objectViewer gs: // test1'command, you can set permissions for all users to read the images stored in the Cloud Storage bucket called test1. Use gsutil instead of gcloud for commands for Cloud Storage. ObjectViewer is also the correct way to grant read access to objects in your bucket. The gsutil iam ch command grants all users read permission for the images stored in the bucket. By writing gsutil iam ch allUsers: objectViewer after it, specify all users and set the read permission of the object.
Options 1 and 2 are incorrect. Granting -d removes the permission.
Option 4 is incorrect. gcloud iam ch objectViewer: allUsers gs: // test1 is not a valid command because "objectViewer: allUsers" is reversed.

•	 
gcloud datastore indexes gs: // test1-backup
•	 
gcloud datastore operations gs: // test1-backup
•	 
gcloud datastore export gs: // test1-backup --async
(Correct)
Explanation
Option 4 is the correct answer. You can export Cloud Datastore entities to Cloud Storage by running the command `gcloud datastore export [destination url]`. The gcloud datastore command is a command for managing Cloud Datastore. gcloud datastore export is a command to execute data extraction, and it is executed by specifying the output destination as gcloud datastore export [output destination url] `.
The main actions are:
· Export: exports data to Google Cloud Storage
· Import: Imports data from Google Cloud Storage
· Indexes: Manages CloudFirestore indexes.
· Operations: Manages long-running operations of Cloud Firestore.
Option 1 is incorrect. The command gcloud datastore backup is not a valid command.

As a developer, you are developing an application that performs reads and writes on two Cloud Storage buckets. What settings do applications need to have to get permission to read and write to this Cloud Storage bucket?
•	 
Create a service account and grant a bucket policy that provides read and write permissions.
•	 
Create a federation ID and grant a bucket policy that provides read and write permissions.
•	 
Create a service account and grant it a role that provides read and write permissions.
(Correct)
•	 
Create a federation ID and grant a bucket policy that provides read and write permissions.
Explanation
Option 3 is the correct answer. Service accounts are non-human users and are used by applications and the like to access resources on the cloud without the involvement of end users or to perform actions. You can control permissions on resources by assigning an IAM role to a service account. Therefore, you need to grant a service account for your application to allow reads and writes to this Cloud Storage bucket.
Option 1 is incorrect. Control permissions with an IAM role, not a bucket policy.
Options 2 and 4 are incorrect. Federation ID is an authorization method used when delegating authentication to an external identity provider. You can use this to authenticate to your application or Google Cloud. Not appropriate for this requirement.

You are migrating your database system in your on-premises environment to Google Cloud. You have set a firewall rule to control ingress and egress traffic to the network for the VM, but it seems that the required traffic is blocked.
What is the method for diagnosing firewall traffic conditions?
•	 
Enable logging for subnets where firewalls are installed.
•	 
Enable firewall rule logging for firewall rules
(Correct)
•	 
Enable logging for VPCs with firewalls installed.
•	 
Monitor firewall rules using CloudDebugger.
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer. You can use the firewall rule log to audit, validate, and analyze the effectiveness of firewall rules. For example, you can determine if a firewall rule designed to deny traffic is working as intended. Therefore, by analyzing the firewall rule log, it is possible to verify the communication status to see if the required traffic is blocked.
Option 1 is incorrect. There is no log called the log of the subnet where the firewall is installed. Use the VPC flow log to check access to the subnet.
Option 3 is incorrect. The VPC flow log records the network flow sent and received by the VM instance, and it is not possible to check the traffic status based on the firewall.
Option 4 is incorrect. Cloud Debugger is a service that allows you to investigate the status of a running application in real time without stopping or slowing down the execution speed. It is not possible to check the traffic status based on the firewall.

Your company has decided to set up a Docker container-based CI / CD environment on Google Cloud. You need to create a set of Docker images to better manage groups of containers.
Which command would you run to group the container images?
•	 
Add labels using the "gcloud container images add-label" command.
•	 
Add the configuration using the gcloud container images add-configuration command.
•	 
Add settings using the gcloud beta container images list-tags command.
•	 
Add tags using the gcloud container images add-tag command.
(Correct)
Explanation
Option 4 is the correct answer. You can add tags to images by running the command `gcloud container images add-tag [image name before tagging] [image name after tagging]`. You can use this tag to manage your images. gcloud container is a command that deploys and manages a cluster of machines to run the container. gcloud beta container images add-tag allows you to tag images. Add the actual image name, such as `gcloud container images add-tag [image name before tagging] [image name after tagging]`.
Option 1 is incorrect. gcloud container images add-label is not a valid command.
Option 2 is incorrect. gcloud container images add-configuration is not a valid command.
Option 3 is incorrect. gcloud beta container images list-tags lists the tags.

As an engineer, you are building an application on Google Cloud that uses a distributed architecture. This application uses Cloud Pub / Sub to send messages to components for data analysis. Each message only needs to be sent once, but it seems that it can be sent multiple times by mistake.
Which parameters should be investigated to determine the cause?
•	 
--dead-letter-topic
•	 
--ack-deadline
(Correct)
•	 
--min-retry-delay
•	 
--max-retry-delay
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer. --ack-deadline specifies the number of seconds Cloud Pub / Sub publishers will wait on a retry. If it cannot confirm that the subscriber has received the message within the specified number of seconds, it will retry.
If this value is too small, the subscriber may receive the message correctly, but the message may be sent multiple times. It is necessary to identify the cause of multiple messages being sent by mistake. Therefore, check --ack-deadline to see if the optimal send interval has been set.
Option 1 is incorrect. --dead-letter-topic is a topic that forwards undeliverable messages (dead letter topic). This time it's not undeliverable, so it's irrelevant.
Option 3 is incorrect. --min-retry-delay is the minimum send interval (time) for sending messages in succession. It's possible that the optimal number of seconds to send, not the send interval, is the issue, so check --ack-dead-line.
Option 4 is incorrect. --max-retry-delay is the maximum send interval (time) for sending messages in succession. It's possible that the optimal number of seconds to send, not the send interval, is the issue, so check --ack-dead-line.

You have been asked to check the default region and zone settings.
Which command line commands do you use to display the default regions and zones for a particular project?
•	 
gcloud compute project-info describe --project [PROJECT-ID]
(Correct)
•	 
gcloud compute project-info add-metadata --project = [PROJECT-ID]
•	 
gcloud compute project-info describe --project = [PROJECT-ID]
•	 
gcloud compute project-info add-metadata --project [PROJECT-ID]
Explanation
Option 1 is the correct answer. You can get the compute service settings for the specified project by running the command `gcloud compute project-info describe --project [project ID]`. Use the `gcloud compute` command because the default region and zone settings are for compute services. By adding project-info describe, it becomes a command to get a specific project setting.
Option 3 is incorrect. gcloud compute project-info describe --project = [PROJECT-ID] Instead, enter the project name with gcloud compute project-info describe --project [project ID] in between.
Options 2 and 4 are incorrect. gcloud compute project-info add-metadata is a command used to set metadata.

(Correct)
•	 
gcloud images create testimage1 --source-snapshot = test1
•	 
gcloud create images create testimage1 --source-snapshot = test1
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer. You can create a new virtual image from a snapshot by running the command `gcloud compute images create [new image name] --source-snapshot = [snapshot name]`.
Option 1 is incorrect. The gcloud compute disks create testimage1 is a command that creates disks to attach to a virtual machine. 
Option 3 is incorrect. gcloud images create testimage1 is out of order and is not a valid command.
Option 4 is incorrect. gcloud create images create testimage1 is out of order and is not a valid command.

You have set up a persistent disk to connect to an instance running as a service account. Then you want to set the metadata for the instance that runs as a service account.
Select the role you need to do this.
•	 
roles / iam.instanceAdmin.v1
•	 
roles / compute.serviceAccountCreator
•	 
roles / iam.serviceAccountCreator
•	 
roles / compute.instanceAdmin.v1
(Correct)
Explanation
Option 4 is the correct answer. Roles / compute.instanceAdmin.v1 is required to populate the instance with metadata. Members with both roles / compute.instanceAdmin.v1 and roles / iam.serviceAccountUser can create and manage instances that use the service account. Specifically, the following permissions are set:
-Create an instance to run as a service account
-Connecting a persistent disk to an instance running as a service account
-Setting instance metadata for an instance running as a service account
-Connect using SSH to an instance running as a service account
-Reconfiguring an instance running as a service account 

Option 1 is incorrect. There is no role called roles / iam.instanceAdmin.v1. Option 2 is incorrect. There is no role called roles / compute.serviceAccountCreator.
Option 3 is incorrect. roles / iam.serviceAccountCreator has the right to create a service account and not the right to operate resources as a service account.

Your company stores internal documents in Cloud Storage buckets and uses them as a shared document management system. As a security officer, you need to make sure that all data written to this storage is encrypted.
Which of the following is the procedure for encrypting data when storing it in a CloudStorage bucket?
•	 
Encryption is performed by default.
(Correct)
•	 
Enable encryption when creating a Cloud Storage bucket.
•	 
Set encryption in the life cycle policy settings.
•	 
Set encryption by bucket policy.
Explanation
Option 1 is the correct answer. All data stored in Cloud Storage is automatically encrypted by default. The encryption methods of Cloud Storage are as follows: 

■ Server-side encryption Encryption that takes place after Cloud Storage receives the data, where the data is encrypted and then written to disk and stored. Uses the following two encryption keys:
-Can be managed using your own encryption key. These keys act as additional encryption that enhances standard Cloud Storage encryption. 
-KMS allows you to create and manage cryptographic keys. These keys act as additional encryption that enhances standard Cloud Storage encryption. 

■ Client-side encryption Encryption takes place before the data is sent to Cloud Storage. Such data is sent encrypted to Cloud Storage, but it is also encrypted on the server side. 

Options 2, 3 and 4 are incorrect. Encryption when writing to storage is performed automatically and does not need to be set separately by the user.

Your company is developing an application that performs data processing every 30 minutes. This application is developed on App Engine and runs batch jobs. There is a problem with the execution interval of this batch job and it needs to be improved.
Which file would you edit to fix this issue?
•	 
cron.yaml
(Correct)
•	 
config.yaml
•	 
setting.yaml
•	 
app.yaml
Explanation
Option 1 is the correct answer. cron.yaml is a file for setting a scheduled task (cron job) that operates at a specified time or at regular intervals. It is necessary to modify cron.yaml in order to modify the periodic processing such as batch jobs.

Option 2 is incorrect. A file called config.yaml does not exist as a configuration file for App Engine.
Option 3 is incorrect. The file setting.yaml does not exist as a configuration file for App Engine.
Option 4 is incorrect. app.yaml is a file that describes settings related to the application, the entire network, and the programming language runtime. This time it doesn't matter.

The company uses multiple Compute Engines to develop applications. This application needs redundancy to withstand zone failures by scaling up and down depending on the load.
Which feature of Compute Engine do you want to use?
•	 
Unmanaged instance group
•	 
Instance template
•	 
Managed instance group
(Correct)
•	 
Resource group
Explanation
Option 3 is the correct answer. Managed instance groups allow multiple application operations on the same VM. This is best used when creating a redundant configuration that can withstand zone failures. Managed instance groups provide features such as auto-scaling, auto-repair, multi-zone deployment, and auto-update for scalable and highly available workload processing.
Option 1 is incorrect. Unmanaged instance groups are a good place to load balance a group of heterogeneous instances, or if you need to manage your own instances. Therefore, it is easier to set up this requirement by using a managed instance group.
Option 2 is incorrect. Instance templates are templates that you can use to create virtual machine instances and managed instance groups, and are not relevant here.
Option 4 is incorrect. Resource groups are a feature in Cloud Monitoring to define a set of resources as a group and are not relevant here.

Question 13: 
Skipped
The development team used the service account to develop the application, but the error occurred due to poor access control between resources. You decide to identify the cause by viewing the audit log.
Which log should you check?
•	 
Policy deny audit log
(Correct)
•	 
Data access audit log
•	 
Management activity log
•	 
ID access audit log
Explanation
Option 1 is the correct answer. If an error occurs because access control between resources is not possible, access is denied by the policy. Therefore, it is necessary to check the status of policy denials and to check the policy denial audit log. The policy denial audit log is recorded when the Google Cloud service denies access to a user or service account due to a policy violation.
Option 2 is incorrect. The data access audit log is irrelevant this time because it records API calls to read resource configurations and metadata, as well as user-driven API calls to create, modify, and read user-supplied resource data.
Option 3 is incorrect. This time it is irrelevant because the management activity log records events related to API calls and other management actions that change the resource's configuration or metadata.
Option 4 is incorrect. There is no audit log named ID Access Audit Log.

As an infrastructure administrator, you manage Cloud Storage on Google Cloud. You want to know the creation time and content type of a stored object.
Which command do you use to get the metadata for the object?
•	 
gsutil version gs: // BUCKET_NAME / OBJECT_NAME
•	 
gsutil list gs: // BUCKET_NAME / OBJECT_NAME
•	 
gsutil describe gs: // BUCKET_NAME / OBJECT_NAME
•	 
gsutil stat gs: // BUCKET_NAME / OBJECT_NAME
(Correct)
Explanation
Option 4 is the correct answer. You can get the metadata of an object by running the command `gsutil stat gs: // [bucket name] / [object name]`.
Option 1 is incorrect. Running gsutil version will print the version of the gsutil tool.
Option 2 is incorrect. gsutil list is not a valid command.
Option 3 is incorrect. gsutil describe is not a valid command.

Your company must authorize the auditor to review the audit logs in order to perform an IT audit. Which of the following roles can be used to grant the minimum required permissions without granting more permissions than required to read the log?
•	 
roles / logging.privateLogReader
•	 
roles / logging.admin.privateLogReader
•	 
roles / logging.privateLogsViewer
(Correct)
•	 
roles / logging.admin.privateLogViewer
Explanation
Option 3 is the correct answer. roles / logging.privateLogViewer grants read permission to all logs, including access transparency logs and data access audit logs. Only the roles / logging.privateLogsViewer should be set because the auditor only needs to be granted read permission.

Option 1 is incorrect. There is no role called roles / logging.privateLogReader.
Option 2 is incorrect. Since roles / logging.admin grants full permissions to Logging, it grants more permissions than required. This is an inappropriate setting that violates the principle of least privilege.
Option 4 is incorrect. roles / logging.admin.privateLogViewer does not grant read permission for data access audit logs, which is an inappropriate setting.

How should you switch clients?
•	 
Create a configuration for each client and activate it with the gcloudauth command.
•	 
Create a configuration for each client and activate it with the gcloud config configuration activate command.
(Correct)
•	 
Apply the configuration role for each client and activate it for each client with the gcloud config configuration activate command.
•	 
Apply the settings role for each client and it for each client with the gcloudauth command.
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer. You can quickly change the Cloud SDK (gcloud command) settings by running the command `gcloud config configurations activate [configuration name]`. This makes it easy to switch between working clients.
Option 1 is incorrect. The `gcloud auth` command is for authenticating your Google Cloud account and is not relevant here.

You are using the Google Kubernetes Engine to set up your service. In doing so, you need to ensure that all internal clients send requests to stable internal IP addresses.
What type of service should you create?
•	 
ClusterIP
(Correct)
•	 
NodePort
•	 
LoadBalancer
•	 
ExternalName
Explanation
Option 1 is the correct answer. Specify the Cluster IP type for all internal clients to send requests to a stable internal IP address. When you create a Service of type ClusterIP, the Service is assigned an internal (virtual) IP address that can only be communicated within the cluster.
Option 2 is incorrect. If you specify the NodePort type, you can access the Service from the outside with the IP address of the Node and the port number specified in advance. The NodePort type is irrelevant to internal network communication and is therefore incorrect.
Option 3 is incorrect. If you specify the LoadBalancer type, you can use the load balancer provided by Google Cloud to expose the Service to the outside of the cluster. The LoadBalancer type is irrelevant to internal network communication and is incorrect.
Option 4 is incorrect. If you specify the ExternalName type, when traffic is received, it can be forwarded to the external site according to the CNAME addressed to the external domain specified in advance. It is irrelevant to allow all internal clients to send requests to a stable internal IP address, which is incorrect.

You have enabled audit logging for Google Cloud management. Then, the storage usage fee has increased significantly.
What type of audit log do you think is the cause?
•	 
Data access audit log
(Correct)
•	 
Data traffic audit log
•	 
System event audit log
•	 
Traffic audit log
Explanation
Option 1 is the correct answer. If you enable the data access audit log, the log is generated every time data access occurs, which makes the data size very large and causes an increase in cost. Therefore, it is disabled by default except for BigQuery. Must be explicitly enabled to write data access audit logs for Google Cloud services other than BigQuery.
Option 2 is incorrect. There is no type of audit log called data traffic audit log.
Option 3 is incorrect. The system event audit log is a log when the configuration of Google Cloud resources is changed, and the data size does not become very large. System event audit logs are generated by Google's system and not by direct user action.
Option 4 is incorrect. There is no type of audit log called traffic audit log.

Which features of Compute Engine do you use for that?
•	 
Image management group
•	 
Image family
(Correct)
•	 
Resource group
•	 
Instance group
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer. Use the image family to release a new version of each image while retaining the ability to roll back to a previous version as needed. Image families allow you to group related images and perform rollforward and rollback between specific image versions.
Option 1 is incorrect. A feature called image management groups does not exist in Compute Engine.
Option 3 is incorrect. Resource group is a function to manage a series of resources as a group in Cloud Monitoring.
Option 4 is incorrect. An instance group is a collection of virtual machine (VM) instances that can be managed as a single entity. Compute Engine has two types of instance groups: managed and unmanaged.

The concern is performance degradation when users connect to the application.
You would like to see additional instances added to my App Engine application when there are 21 or more concurrent requests. Which parameters should be specified in app.yaml?
•	 
max_concurrent_requests
(Correct)
•	 
target_throughput_utilization
•	 
max_instances
•	 
max_pending_latency
Explanation
Option 1 is the correct answer.
max_concurrent_requests allows you to specify the maximum number of concurrent requests before another instance is started. So option 1 is the correct answer. target_throughput_utilization works similarly, but specifies the maximum throughput utilization using a scale of 0.05 to 0.95. max_instances specifies the maximum number of instances, not the criteria for adding instances. max_pending latency is based on the amount of time a request waits, not the number of requests.

•	 
Concurrency quantity
(Correct)
•	 
CPU usage
•	 
Number of requests
•

As a result of IT audits, your company needs to set bucket-level access to Cloud Storage buckets. However, after applying bucket-level access control, some users who could access the objects in the bucket have now lost access.
Which of the following is the most likely cause?
•	 
They can't be accessed because you don't have the IAM permission to allow the user to access the objects in your bucket.
(Correct)
•	 
They cannot access it because there is no ACL that allows the user to access the objects in the bucket.
•	 
Uniform bucket policies do not allow you to control user permissions and must be changed to ACLs.
•	 
Cannot access because there is no firewall that allows the user to access the objects in the bucket.
Explanation
Option 1 is the correct answer. When you enable uniform bucket-level access for a bucket, access control lists (ACLs) are disabled, and only bucket-level IAM permissions grant access to that bucket and the objects in it. Therefore, if a previously accessible user was accessing it through an ACL, it is likely that they are no longer able to access it because they do not have IAM privileges after configuring the bucket-level access.
Options 2 and 3 are incorrect. Since access is not possible because there is no IAM permission setting, access is not possible even if ACL is attached.
Option 4 is incorrect. Firewalls set up traffic communication for virtual networks. This time, access is disabled after changing the bucket level access settings, so it is considered that the traffic communication control settings are irrelevant.

Create constrained data lifecycle management policies at the organizational level of the resource hierarchy to limit where resources are available.
•	 
Create constrained data lifecycle management policies at the folder level of the resource hierarchy to limit where resources are available.
•	 
Create constrained policies at the folder level in the resource hierarchy to limit where resources are available.
•	 
Create constrained policies at the organizational level of the resource hierarchy to limit where resources are available.
(Correct)
Explanation
Option 4 is the correct answer. Constraints are a standard way to limit where resources can be created, and you can apply constrained policies to limit resource usage in a particular region. If the policy is applied at the folder level, it is inefficient to set overall resource limits as in this case, as the policy must be applied to every folder individually. Therefore, you must create constrained policies at the organization level to limit resource usage at the organization level.
Option 1 is incorrect. The data lifecycle management policy is used for management such as deleting data after a specific period. It is incorrect because it has nothing to do with this scenario.
Options 2 and 3 are incorrect. If the policy is applied at the folder level, it would be inefficient to set overall resource limits as in this case, as the policy would have to be applied to every folder individually. Therefore, create constrained policies at the organization level to limit resource usage at the organization level.

As a solution architect, you are building an image analysis system that uses an image identification API. Processing by this image identification API takes about 5 seconds for each image. The frequency of image processing is highly volatile, as there are periods when images are not uploaded and there are periods when many images are uploaded in a short period of time.
Which service should you use to build this image processing application?
•	 
Compute Engine
•	 
Cloud Dataflow
•	 
Cloud Functions
(Correct)
•	 
Container Registry
Explanation
Option 3 is the correct answer. If the frequency of image processing is highly volatile, such as when images are not uploaded or when many images are uploaded in a short period of time, it is inefficient to use an application that always starts a VM. It will be. Therefore, it is best to use a serverless application that is charged only when it is used. This time, it is best to use Cloud Functions to execute the work process using the image identification API. Cloud Functions can develop Google Cloud event response processing such as uploading files to Cloud Storage serverlessly.
By using Cloud Functions, you can complete the analysis process within the time limit. You don't have to run the application continuously to see new image uploads, as there are periods when images aren't uploaded. Therefore, there is no need for a full-scale system configuration using App Engine Flexible, Cloud Engine, Kubernetes Engine, etc.
Option 1 is incorrect. Compute Engine is a service that allows you to rent virtual machines for an hourly fee. Costs will be incurred due to pay-as-you-go billing according to the startup time. This time, in addition to calling the process using the image identification API to execute the work process, it is more cost-effective to use Cloud Functions for the process using the virtual server because there is volatility in the execution frequency.
Option 2 is incorrect. Cloud Dataflow is a stream and batch processing service. Cloud Dataflow can perform ETL processing in a fully managed environment. It is not suitable for work processes like this one.
Option 4 is incorrect. Container Registry provides centralized management and vulnerability analysis of Docker images. Fine-grained access control also allows you to decide which users are allowed access to what. Therefore, it has nothing to do with this case.

An instance of Compute Engine utilizes a persistent disk, and you were asked to clone this persistent disk. In that case, the specific elements must be the same on the source disk and the clone disk. Which elements should be the same?
•	 
zone
(Correct)
•	 
size
•	 
snap shot
•	 
VPC
Explanation
Option 1 is the correct answer. When cloning a persistent disk, the source and clone disks must be in the same zone and region and of the same type.
Option 2 is incorrect. The size of the clone must be greater than or equal to the size of the source disk. It doesn't have to be the same.
Option 3 is incorrect. This time it doesn't matter because snapshots are used when data protection is needed to improve restoring, such as backup or disaster recovery.
Option 4 is incorrect. The VPCs do not have to be the same. The source and clone discs must be in the same zone and region and of the same type.

Preemptible virtual machines are shut down after a certain amount of time has passed since they were run.
Which of the following times is it?
•	 
12 hours
•	 
24 hours
(Correct)
•	 
36 hours
•	 
48 hours
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer. If the preemptive machine is not shut down within 24 hours, Google will stop the instance. This stop is called a preempt.
Preemptible VM instances are much cheaper than standard VMs (60-91% discount). However, the Compute Engine may stop this instance if it needs to reclaim compute capacity for allocation to other VMs. Preemptable Instances are a feature that takes advantage of Compute Engine's surplus capacity, and availability depends on usage.
Preemptible instances behave like regular instances, but with the following limitations:
· The Compute Engine can stop a preemptible instance at any time due to a system event. It is unlikely that the Compute Engine will shut down a preemptible instance due to a system event, but it can vary from zone to zone on a daily basis, depending on the circumstances at the time.
· The Compute Engine always shuts down the preemptible instance after running for 24 hours. 
· Preemptible instances are finite Compute Engine resources and are not always available. ·
Preemptible instances cannot become regular VM instances through Live migration. Also, it cannot be set to restart automatically in the event of a maintenance event.
· Because of these restrictions, preemptible instances are not covered by service level agreements. They are excluded from Compute Engine SLAs
・ Compute Engine Free tier for Google Cloud does not apply to preemptible instances.

A certain application uses Compute Engine to execute a daily batch job at 1am in the middle of the night to back up data. These jobs take about an hour to complete. The data is not very important, so backups do not always need to be successful every day. Choose a Compute Engine configuration that minimizes costs from the following.
•	 
Use a micro-instance type 3-node cluster in Compute Engine.
•	 
Use N2 machine type preemptive VM instances in Compute Engine.
•	 
Use a single node cluster of N2 machine type in Compute Engine.
•	 
Use E2 standard machine type preemptive VM instances in Compute Engine.
(Correct)
Explanation
Option 4 is the correct answer. Since the purpose of this scenario is to execute the process for only one hour a day, it is necessary to select the best instance type to execute at a low price in the short term. In this case, you can minimize the cost by using a preemptible VM.
Preemptible VMs are instances that can be created and run at a much lower cost than regular instances. However, the Compute Engine can stop this instance if other tasks require access to the resource. Preemptable Instances are a feature that takes advantage of Compute Engine's surplus capacity, and availability depends on usage. The E2 machine type is a cost-optimized VM that provides up to 32 vCPUs with up to 8 GB per vCPU and up to 128 GB of memory. It is the most suitable type for finding the most cost-optimized processing like this time.
Option 1 is incorrect. Using a micro-instance type 3-node cluster is too high performance and is costly.
Options 2 and 3 are incorrect. For N2 machine types, up to 80 vCPUs and 8 GB of memory per vCPU are available on the Intel Cascade Lake CPU platform. This is more powerful and more expensive than the E2 machine type.

The company is building a mobile app where users can share photos. This mobile app stores photos in Cloud Storage and created two buckets for redundancy. Which command should you use to synchronize the contents of the two buckets?
•	 
gcloud rsync
•	 
gsutil rsync
(Correct)
•	 
gsutil cp sync
•	 
gcloud cp sync
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer. gsutil is a command line tool for working with Cloud Storage. The gsutil rsync command can synchronize a local directory to a bucket. You can use this to synchronize the contents of the two buckets.  For example, you can use the following commands to match the contents of :
gs: // example-bucket and the local directory of local-dir:
gsutil -m rsync -r local-dir gs: // example-bucket  If you use the rsync -d flag, it will tell gsutil to delete files in the sync destination (gs: // example-bucket) that do not exist in the sync source (local-dir). In this way you can also sync between the two buckets. 
Options 1 and 4 are incorrect. A command line tool for gsutil to work with Cloud Storage, not gcloud.
Option 3 is incorrect. There is no command called gsutil cp sync.

•	 
Disable autoscaling and set the number of instances to launch to 1.
•	 
Enable autoscaling and set the number of instances to launch to 1.
•	 
Disable autoscaling and set the minimum number of instances to 1 and the maximum number to 1.
•	 
Enable autoscaling and set the minimum number of instances to 1 and the maximum number to 1.
(Correct)
Explanation
Option 4 is the correct answer. You can maintain 1 VM instance at all times by enabling autoscaling for your instance group and setting the minimum number of instances to 1 and the maximum number to 1. Autoscaling adds VMs to managed instance groups under heavy load and removes VMs when the need for VMs decreases. In other words, if the minimum number is 1, the number of instances is adjusted so that the minimum value is 1 at the time of scale-in, and if the maximum number is 1, the number of instances is adjusted so that the maximum value is 1 at the time of scale-out. As a result, the number of instances can always be 1.

As a system administrator, you are using the Operations Suite Logging to configure Google Cloud logging. Which service is incorrect destination for LogSync's log forwarding?
•	 
CloudSQL
(Correct)
•	 
Cloud Storage bucket
•	 
BigQuery dataset
•	 
Cloud Pub / Sub topic
Explanation
Option 1 is the correct answer. CloudSQL is not available as a destination for logging exports. You can use a log router to forward specific logs to supported destinations in any Cloud project. The log destinations supported by Logging are:
- Saving them as JSON files in your Cloud Storage bucket. This provides low-cost long-term storage.
- Creating a table in your BigQuery dataset. This provides big data analysis function.
- Deliver JSON-formatted messages to Pub / Sub topics. 
- Logging integration with third parties such as Splunk is supported.
- Retaining log entries in the Cloud Logging log bucket. This provides Cloud Logging storage with a customizable retention period.x 
Options 2, 3 and 4 are incorrect because they are correct. Cloud Storage buckets, BigQuery datasets, and Cloud Pub / Sub topics are all three Log Destinations supported by Logging.

As a system administrator, you are performing log analysis for Operations Suite Logging. Which of the following has the ability to filter and display the logs?
•	 
Log Explorer
(Correct)
•	 
Log viewer
•	 
Log router
•	 
Log sync
Explanation
Option 1 is the correct answer. Use Log Explorer in the Google Cloud Console to provide recommended queries that make it easier to find important logs. Log Explorer uses Boolean expressions to specify specific parts of a project's entire log entry. You can use such queries to select log entries from a particular log or log service, or log entries that meet the criteria for metadata or user-defined fields.
Option 2 is incorrect. Log Viewer is an analysis tool previously used by Log Explorer.
Option 3 is incorrect. Cloud Logging receives log entries through the Cloud Logging API, and in the process the log entries go through the log router. The log router sink matches each log entry against existing inclusion and exclusion filters to determine whether to send the log entry to a destination, such as a Cloud Logging bucket, or to exclude Cloud Logging ingestion altogether.
Option 4 is incorrect. Sync is used to forward logs to multiple destinations.

Where can you check the status of BigQuery service in Google Cloud?
•	 
Google Cloud Status Dashboard
(Correct)
•	 
BigQuery console
•	 
Cloud Customer Care Portfolio
•	 
TAM
Explanation
Option 1 is the correct answer. The Google Cloud Status Dashboard (https://status.cloud.google.com/) provides information about the status of Google Cloud services. It is possible to check the status of the BigQuery service.
Option 2 is incorrect. Check in the Google Cloud Status Dashboard instead of the Bigquery console.
Option 3 is incorrect. The Cloud Customer Care Portfolio is a scalable and flexible set of services centered around user needs. This has nothing to do with checking the status of the service.
Option 4 is incorrect. By subscribing to Premium Support, you will receive support for critical user awareness workloads from a dedicated Technical Account Manager (TAM). This has nothing to do with checking the status of the service.

•	 
BigQuery and CloudPub / Sub
•	 
Compute Engine and BigQuery
•	 
Kubernetes Engine and BigQuery
•	 
Compute Engine and Kubernetes Engine
(Correct)
Explanation
Option 4 is the correct answer. Both Compute Engine and Kubernetes Engine base their costs on virtual machines. Compute Engine calculates disk size, machine type memory, and network usage in gigabytes (GB). With KubernetesEngine, the clusters you create will incur a flat rate of $ 0.10 per cluster for one hour after the free tier expires, plus CPU, memory, and ephemeral storage computing resources provisioned in the pod.

You are in charge of the task of starting and managing VMs using Compute Engine. Which feature do you use for dynamic provisioning based on a dedicated configuration file?
•	 
Managed instance group
(Correct)
•	 
Unmanaged instance group
•	 
Service account
•	 
Instance cluster
Explanation
Option 1 is the correct answer. You can utilize a managed instance group (MIG) for dynamic provisioning based on a dedicated configuration file. MIG is a redundantly configurable group that allows applications to be deployed on multiple identical VMs. You can perform auto-scaling, auto-repair, region (multi-zone) deployment, auto-update, and more for the instances that make up a managed instance group for scalable and highly available workload processing. 
Option 2 is incorrect. non-managed instance groups allow load balancing across a set of VMs that you manage yourself. Managed instance groups are best suited for configurations where automatic provisioning is performed.
Option 3 is incorrect. Service accounts are special accounts used by applications and virtual machine (VM) instances, not users. The application uses the service account to make authorized API calls. It is approved as the service account itself, or as a Google Workspace or Cloud Identity user by domain-wide delegation.
Option 4 is incorrect. There is no group called an instance cluster, but if you are using Docker you can configure a cluster with VMs.

You received an e-mail from one of our executives asking for advice on building a proposal system to enhance product sales.
It sounds like this executive has heard about a GCP solution that seems to be the perfect fit for solving such a problem. Which GCP services would you recommend investigating?
•	 
Cloud Dataproc. Especially Spark and machine learning libraries
(Correct)
•	 
Cloud Dataproc. In particular, Hadoop
•	 
Cloud Spanner. It is a global relational database that can store large amounts of data
•	 
Because Cloud SQLSQL is a powerful query language
Explanation
Option 1 is the correct answer.
Using Spark and its learning library with Dataproc is perfect for this use case.

Option 2 suggests Hadoop, but it's not a good choice for machine learning applications.

Option 3 is incorrect. Spanner is designed as a global relational database to support transaction processing systems, not analytics and machine learning systems.

Option 4 is incorrect. SQL is a powerful query language, but it doesn't support the kind of machine learning algorithms needed to solve the problem presented.

Your database administrator has asked me to export a MySQL database in Cloud SQL. A database administrator loads the data into another relational database, but does so with minimal effort. In particular, this loading method does not require the database administrator to define a schema. Which file format do you recommend for this task?
•	 
SQL
(Correct)
•	 
CSV
•	 
XML
•	 
JSON
Explanation
Your database administrator has asked me to export a MySQL database in Cloud SQL. A database administrator loads the data into another relational database, but does so with minimal effort. In particular, this loading method does not require the database administrator to define a schema. Which file format do you recommend for this task?Option 1 is the correct answer.
Option 1, SQL format, exports the database as a series of SQL data definition commands. These commands can be run on another relational database without creating the schema first.

Option 2 can also be used, but requires column mapping in the created schema before loading the CSV. Database administrators want to avoid this task.

Also option 3 and option 4 are incorrect. Not an export file format option.

Your company uses Google Cloud billing accounts in multiple departments, and billing processing is mixed. To properly track your department's spending, you need to link your project to your billing account.
Who can perform this operation?
•	 
Billing account owner
•	 
Billing Account Viewer
•	 
Billing account user
(Correct)
•	 
Billing account creator
Explanation
Option 3 is the correct answer. Billing Account User (roles / billing.user) can link the project to the billing account. The permissions for this role are heavily restricted due to the need for increased security and are commonly used in combination with the project creator. These two roles allow you to create a new project linked to the billing account to which the role is granted. 
Option 1 is incorrect. The role of billing account owner does not exist.
Option 2 is incorrect. The billing account viewer (roles / billing.viewer) is the right to view cost information and transactions for billing accounts. You cannot link or unlink projects.
Option 4 is incorrect. The billing account creator (roles / billing.creator) is authorized to create new billing accounts and cannot link or unlink projects.

You are managing your company’s first Google Cloud project. Project leads, developers, and internal testers will participate in the project, which includes sensitive information.
You need to ensure that only specific members of the development team have access to sensitive information. You want to assign the appropriate Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles that also require the least amount of maintenance. What should you do?
•	 
Assign a basic role to each user.
•	 
Create groups. Assign a basic role to each group, and then assign users to groups
•	 
Create groups. Assign a Custom role to each group, including those who should have access to sensitive data.
•	 
Create groups. Assign an IAM Predefined role to each group as required, including those who should have access to sensitive data.
(Correct)
Explanation
Option4 is correct because Predefined roles are fine-grained enough to set permissions for specific roles requiring sensitive data access. This solution also uses groups, which is the recommended practice for managing permissions for individual roles.

Option1 is not correct for two reasons: The recommended practice is to use groups and not to assign roles to each user. Beyond that, Basic Roles do not have enough granularity to account for access to sensitive data.

Option2 is not correct because Basic roles do not have enough granularity to account for access to sensitive data.

Option3 is not correct because creating and maintaining Custom roles will require more maintenance than using Predefined roles.

You are implementing Cloud Storage for your organization. You need to follow your organization’s regulations. They include: 1) Archive data older than one year. 2) Delete data older than 5 years. 3) Use standard storage for all other data. You want to implement these guidelines automatically and in the simplest manner available. What should you do?
•	 
Set up Object Lifecycle management policies.
(Correct)
•	 
Run a script daily. Copy data that is older than one year to an archival bucket, and delete five-year-old data.
•	 
Run a script daily. Set storage class to ARCHIVE for data that is older than one year, and delete five-year-old data.
•	 
Set up default storage class for three buckets named: STANDARD, ARCHIVE, DELETED. Use a script to move the data in the appropriate bucket when its condition matches your company guidelines.
Explanation
Option1 is correct because Object Lifecycle allows you to automate the implementation of your organization’s data policy. Option2 is not correct because changing an object's storage class does not require copying the object to another bucket. Option3 is not correct because it requires custom programming. Option4 is not correct because moving an object to a DELETED bucket does not really delete it. reference: https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/lifecycle https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/storage-classes

Question 1: Incorrect
You are creating a virtual machine for new application development. In this application development, VMs with the same configuration are created and deleted repeatedly in order to perform the test multiple times. You need to configure it so as to minimize the steps taken to boot a properly configured VM.
Which setting do you want to use?
•	 
Find the best machine image provided by Google Cloud and create a VM. Install the non-standard library there and take a snapshot to use to launch other instances.
(Incorrect)
•	 
Install a non-standard library of images that is close to the VM you have set up. Create a machine image to use to launch other instances.
(Correct)
•	 
Find the best machine image provided by Google Cloud and create a VM. Install the non-standard library there and create a machine image to use to boot other instances.
•	 
Install the non-standard library, save it in Cloud Storage, and configure the VM. Create a snapshot from this VM that will be used to launch other instances.
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer. To minimize the steps required to boot a well-configured VM, you need to boot multiple virtual machines with a machine image. First create a machine image with a non-standard library of images that is close to what you need. Then launch an instance with that machine image.
A machine image is a Compute Engine resource that stores all configurations, metadata, permissions, and data from multiple disks in a virtual machine (VM) instance. Machine images can be used in many system maintenance, backup and restore, and instance cloning scenarios.
Options 1 and 3 are incorrect. The VM generated from the optimal machine image provided by Google Cloud is not the optimal virtual machine configuration for the user. You need to install your own library to optimize the VM.
Options 1 and 4 are incorrect. A snapshot is a backup used when restoring an optical disc. Not available when replicating a virtual machine.
Question 2: Incorrect
Your company is developing a large application on Google Cloud. Hosting this application requires running many instances at the same time. In order to avoid issues, it is necessary to set the instances so that they do not interfere with each other.

•	 
Split them into instance groups.
•	 
Implement a distributed configuration with instance clusters.
(Incorrect)
•	 
Divide the instance into partition groups.
•	 
No special settings are needed.
(Correct)
Explanation
Option 4 is the correct answer. By default, Google Cloud Compute Engine instances are virtualized into their separate environments so they don't interfere with each other without you having to do anything.
Therefore, no special action is required.

You are trying to list role permissions using the Google Cloud console. If you use the form that appears after you click the "Add" link in your IAM form, you'll see the New Member parameter.
Which item should be set for this parameter?
•	 
Individual users and roles
•	 
Groups and roles
•	 
Individual users or groups
(Correct)
•	 
Individual users
Explanation
Option 3 is the correct answer. You can add new members by specifying individual users (email addresses) and Google groups in the parameter "new members" on the IAM console screen.
Identity and Access Management (IAM) allows you to create and manage permissions for Google Cloud resources. IAM integrates access control for Google Cloud services into one system to provide consistent operations.
Options 1 and 2 are incorrect. You cannot enter a role in "New Member".
Option 4 is incorrect. The "New Member" parameter allows you to enter groups as well as individual users.

You are trying to list role permissions using the Google Cloud console.
Which of the following options is the incorrect process for checking the permissions of a custom role?
•	 
Run the gcloud iam roles describe command to list the permissions for the role.
•	 
Call the roles.get () REST API method to list the permissions of the role.
•	 
Search the permission reference to see if the role grants the permission.
(Correct)
•	 
On the IAM and admin screens, select Roles. Select the check box next to a role to display the permissions for that role.
Explanation
Option 3 is the correct answer. Only basic and predefined roles can be searched for permission references to see if a role grants permissions. This process for checking the permissions of a custom role is incorrect. Use one of the following methods to determine if a role contains the appropriate permissions:
■ Run the gcloud iam roles describe command to list the permissions for the role.
■ Invoke the roles.get () REST API method to list the permissions of the roles.
■ Basic and predefined roles only: Search the permission reference to see if the role grants the permission.
■ Predefined roles only: See the description of the predefined roles to see the permissions contained in the role. 
Also, select [Role] on the IAM and administrator screens. You can also select the check box next to a role to display the permissions for that role.

Option 5 is the wrong choice. The engine type is not used as a parameter when creating a cluster. A Kubernetes cluster is a collection of nodes that run containerized applications. You can containerize your application to package your application with application dependencies and multiple required services. Kubernetes Engine allows you to specify projects, regions, zones, machine types, number of nodes, etc. when creating a cluster.
It cannot be changed after the cluster is created. These choices affect cluster availability, version stability, and network.

Option 2 is the correct answer. The name of the pod spec you created in the previous step. The configuration information about how to communicate with the API is stored in the kubeconfig file. If you run multiple clusters within your Google Cloud project, you need to choose which cluster will communicate with kubectl. To do this, you can set the default cluster for kubectl by setting the current context in the Kubernetes kubeconfig file. Kubernetes uses a YAML file called kubeconfig, and stores the kubectl cluster credentials. kubeconfig contains a list of contexts referenced by kubectl when command is excecuted. By default, this file is saved in $ HOME / .kube / config
Option 1 is incorrect. config.yaml is a commonly used configuration file name, but not a Kubernetes configuration file.
Option 3 is incorrect. pod-file-name.yaml is a file that defines the name of the pod specification created in the previous step.
Option 4 is incorrect. The file kbconfig..yaml does not exist.

You want to implement a mechanism in Google Cloud that simplifies the provisioning method of web applications. If you're developing an application with App Engine, which options are available to determine how to split traffic between application versions?
•	 
IP address, HTTP cookie, and random selection
•	 
HTTP Cookies and Random Selection
•	 
IP address and HTTP cookie
(Correct)
•	 
IP address and random selection
Explanation
Option 3 is the correct answer. App Engine allows you to choose whether to use IP address splitting or HTTP cookie splitting when splitting traffic between two or more versions of your application.  When you have specified two or more versions for splitting, you must choose whether to split traffic by using either an IP address or HTTP cookie. It's easier to set up an IP address split, but a cookie split is more precise.

■ IP address split For IP address splitting, when an application receives a request, it translates the IP address into a hash value in the range 0-999 and uses that number to route the request. 
■ HTTP cookie split In the case of HTTP cookie splitting, the application routes the request based on the value stored in the cookie called GOOGAPPUID in the HTTP request header. If the cookie GOOGAPPUID does not exist, the request will be routed randomly. 
The traffic split feature allows you to specify a traffic distribution ratio to distribute traffic to multiple versions of the same service.

The application needs to access the drive attached to the virtual machine that has random access to the files.
Which storage type do you use?
•	 
SSD storage only
•	 
Object storage
•	 
File storage
•	 
Block storage
(Correct)
Explanation
Option 4 is the correct answer. Drives connected to virtual machines use block storage as disks. Virtual storage, which is a block storage resource, provides persistent disk space that does not lose its contents when a virtual machine instance is stopped / destroyed. Random access to files is possible by using block storage. Option 1 is incorrect. The connected drive is either an SSD or a hard drive. Therefore, it is not limited to SSD storage only.
Option 2 is incorrect. Object storage is a storage type used in Cloud Storage, etc. It cannot be configured as a drive directly attached to the virtual machine.
Option 3 is incorrect. File storage is a storage type used when making a file system type storage configuration. It cannot be configured as a drive directly attached to the virtual machine.

As a Solutions Architect, you are building an application on Google Cloud. This application should provide maximum flexibility for efficient use of resources and reduce the operational management overhead of the orchestration platform.
Which of the following is the appropriate deployment model?
•	 
Use two large virtual machines and perform a distributed configuration with a load balancer.
•	 
Run in a single large virtual machine.
•	 
Use containers in managed clusters
(Correct)
•	 
Run in a single large virtual machine to configure autoscaling.
Explanation
Option 3 is the correct answer. Containers provide maximum flexibility for efficient use of cluster resources. The orchestration platform reduces operational overhead. Therefore, efficient use of resources is possible by using containers in the cluster that is managed by the user.
Google Cloud uses Kubernetes to perform container orchestration. Kubernetes creates containers to increase the reliability of your compute configuration, reducing the time and resources you spend on DevOps, while also reducing the load associated with these tasks.
Option 1 is incorrect. The load balancer is used to distribute traffic between instances. Configuring a load balancer does not avoid the overhead of orchestration operations. 
Option 2 is incorrect. It is not recommended to run in a single virtual machine as all services will go down if the server fails.
Option 4 is incorrect. As with option 2, it is not recommended to run in a single virtual machine as all services will go down if the server fails.

Your company has decided to build a data warehouse on Google Cloud to analyze business data. In that case, it is a requirement to minimize the time spent on system management. You also want database administrators to scale their data warehousing infrastructure as needed without changing the database configuration.
Which service should you use?
•	 
BigQuery
(Correct)
•	 
Bigtable
•	 
Cloud Dataflow
•	 
Spanner
Explanation
Option 1 is the correct answer. BigQuery is a data warehousing and analytics database managed service that minimizes administrative overhead. You don't even have to configure storage. You can also perform expansion automatically when you expand your data warehousing infrastructure.
Option 2 is incorrect. Bigtable is a NoSQL database and cannot execute the large analytic queries possible in a data warehouse. 
Option 3 is incorrect. Cloud Dataflow is a stream and batch processing service that cannot execute the large analytical queries possible in a data warehouse. 
Option 4 is incorrect. Spanner is a relational database designed for scaling. All the features required of relational databases, such as schemas, SQL queries, and ACID transactions, have been proven and can be scaled globally. It can be used universally as an application database, but it is not a service for use as a data warehouse.

You are configuring a relational database with the new Cloud SQL as the data layer for your web application. Which storage type do you use to store the database data files?
•	 
Object storage
•	 
Block storage
(Correct)
•	 
File storage
•	 
Disk storage
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer. CloudSQL uses block storage. Persistent storage on a block device is required as the storage destination for relational database data, and RDBMS is deployed by storing that data. Block storage is storage that can be used in the same way as a general hard disk. Similar to the hard disk installed in a PC, it can be occupied and used by a specific server.
Option 1 is incorrect. Object storage does not provide storage for databases because it does not provide data blocks or file system storage. Object storage is used for medium- to long-term storage of data such as Cloud Storage.
Option 3 is incorrect. File storage is used as storage for sharing file areas or for storage areas when performing high-speed data processing. It is not used for relational database storage.
Option 4 is incorrect. There is no storage type called disk storage. The disk used for storage is block storage.

When you tried to create a backup of the Datastore, you have received an error message stating that you do not have the proper permissions role to create the Datastore backup.
What permissions do you need for the backup?
•	 
Cloud Datastore Admin
•	 
Cloud Datastore Import Export Admin
(Correct)
•	 
Cloud Datastore data management Admin
•	 
Cloud Datastore Index Admin
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer. The permissions required to create a Datastore backup are Cloud Datastore Import Export Admin role. This gives you the two permissions you need to create a backup. This allows you to assign the user account an IAM role that grants datastore.databases.export permission (if you want to export data) or datastore.databases.import permission (if you want to import data).
Option 1 is incorrect. Datastore Admin grants general administrative privileges. This is too privileged and violates the principle of least privilege.
Option 3 is incorrect. No such authority exists.
Option 4 is incorrect. Datastore Index Admin is a permission to create a data index, and the permission target is different.

Your company has decided to connect Google Cloud to the data center that it uses as its on-premises environment to move towards the use of Google Cloud. You are setting up a router to connect your Google Cloud environment to your on-premises environment.
What unique identifier should you assign to the BGP protocol?
•	 
IP address
•	 
ASN
(Correct)
•	 
Mac address
•	 
VPC ID
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer. The autonomous system number (ASN) is the number used to identify the cloud router on your network. By setting the ASN, you can place and use the cloud router in the network. By entering Google ASN on the router creation screen when setting up a VPN connection, you can set to identify the cloud router on the network.
Option 1 is incorrect. Assigning an IP address does not allow you to assign a unique identifier to the BGP protocol.
Option 3 is incorrect. The MAC address is physically assigned to uniquely identify each carrier on the communication network, and a unique identifier cannot be assigned to the BGP protocol.
Option 4 is incorrect. Assigning a VPC ID does not allow you to assign a unique identifier to the BGP protocol.

You are preparing to deploy your application using App Engine. In that case, you need to set automatic scaling to increase redundancy.
Which metric do you use to scale out when target_throughput_utilization is used?
•	 
CPU usage
•	 
Memory utilization
•	 
Number of simultaneous requests
(Correct)
•	 
Disk IO
Explanation
Option 3 is the correct answer. App Engine calculates the number of instances needed to handle the current application traffic based on scaling settings such as target_cpu_utilization and target_throughput_utilization. Target_throughput_utilization is set at the same time as max_concurrent_requests to specify the maximum number of concurrent requests to the application before scaling up, and when the number of concurrent requests reaches a value equal to the product of max_concurrent_requests and target_throughput_utilization, the autoscaling scheduler will Launch a new instance. 
■ target_throughput_utilization
Optional.
Specify a value between 0.5 and 0.95. The default is 0.6. Used with max_concurrent_requests to specify when concurrent requests launch a new instance. 
■ max_concurrent_requests
Optional.
The number of concurrent requests that an autoscaling instance can accept. If this number is exceeded, the scheduler will create a new instance (default: 10, maximum: 80). Used with target_throughput_utilization to specify when a new instance is launched by a concurrent request.

Your company is developing a microservice type application using multiple VMs on Google Cloud. For coordination between components, it is necessary to grant permissions to the VMs that make up the component to allow them to write to the message queue.
Which setting destination should be used at that time?
•	 
User management service account
(Correct)
•	 
Google management service account
•	 
Google managed project
•	 
User-managed project
Explanation
Option 1 is the correct answer. A service account is a mechanism that authorizes an application or virtual machine to perform a task. It is possible to grant permissions to the application for which the service account is set to allow writing to the message queue.
Service accounts are special accounts used by applications and computing workloads, not users. Service accounts are managed by Identity and Access Management (IAM).
You can use two types of service accounts: user managed service accounts and Google managed service accounts. A user-managed service account connected to a Compute Engine instance provides credentials to applications running on the instance. These credentials are used by your application to authenticate to the Google Cloud API and authorize access to Google Cloud resources.
Option 2 is incorrect. Google Management Services accounts are created, managed by Google, and automatically assigned to your projects. These accounts represent multiple Google services, and each account has a certain level of access to your Google Cloud project. This is not used to grant VM resource permissions. 
Options 3 and 4 are incorrect. There is no project division such as Google managed projects or user managed projects.

You are setting up to create a virtual network on your custom subnet. Efficient traffic control is required by configuring firewalls and applying consistent firewalls throughout the organization.
Which setting should you use for this?
•	 
Associate the hierarchical firewall rule with an organization or folder.
•	 
Associate the VPC firewall policy with your organization or folder.
•	 
Associate the hierarchical firewall policy with an organization or folder.
(Correct)
•	 
Associate the VPC firewall rule with an organization or folder.
Explanation
Option 3 is the correct answer. Hierarchical firewall policies allow you to apply consistent firewall policies throughout your organization. Hierarchical firewall policies are containers for firewall rules, and by associating a policy with an organization or folder, all rules apply to the entire target organization or folder. Similar to Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) firewall rules, these policies include rules that allow you to explicitly deny or allow connections.
Option 1 is incorrect. You need to associate a hierarchical firewall policy with an organization or folder, not a hierarchical firewall rule.
Option 2 is incorrect. There is no feature called VPC firewall policy.
Option 4 is incorrect. VPC firewall rules apply to specific projects and networks. If you want to apply firewall rules to multiple VPC networks in your organization, take advantage of hierarchical firewall policies.
Question 19:

There is a limited number of projects that can be created from one Google Cloud account. The current account you are using has already created a large number of projects, which means you can no longer create new projects.
Which of the following options is the correct way to increase the project limit?
•	 
Submit additional scope tickets to Google Cloud Support.
•	 
Apply to TAM to relax the upper limit.
•	 
Enforce an additional contract with Google Cloud Support.
•	 
Submit a request in Manage Quotas on the Create Project form of the console.
(Correct)
Explanation
Option 4 is the correct answer. In Google Cloud, you can relax the limit by sending a limit relaxation request on the console. The easiest way to increase the project limit is to click the Manage Quotas link on the Create Project form in the console, enter a description about the need to increase the project limit, and submit your request. 
Option 1 is incorrect. Instead of submitting an additional scope ticket to Google Cloud Support, make a cap relaxation request on the console.
Option 2 is incorrect. Technical Account Manager (TAM) is a service where you can get advice from experts. It helps keep your critical Google Cloud services in optimal condition so that you can operate effectively and efficiently in the cloud. It is used for more advanced technical support, not basic support for Google Cloud such as support for implementing cap relaxation.
Option 3 is incorrect. There are no contractual terms such as implementing additional contracts for Google Cloud Support. You simply need to make a normal cap relaxation request.

The company is developing an application that uses Cloud Datastore as a data layer to store images. You are trying to set up data integrity on Cloud Datastore. Cloud Datastore allows you to set strong consistency, but this has disadvantages.
What are the disadvantages of strong integrity?
•	 
I / O operations take longer than eventual consistency.
(Correct)
•	 
Simultaneous reading by multiple users will not be possible.
•	 
The load on the network increases.
•	 
Cost is higher than eventual consistency.
Explanation
Option 1 is the correct answer. By setting strong data integrity, you can ensure data integrity so that if there is data that has undergone a write operation or an update operation, the data before the update will not be read. However, with strong data consistency, I / O operations are more time consuming than eventual consistency models, as all duplicated copies must be synchronized before operations such as updates are completed. increase. This is a disadvantage.
Eventual consistency model is a consistency model that may cause a discrepancy between the data update process and the read process because the process is performed based on the loose consistency that the data should be synchronized as a result. It is not possible to prevent the data before the update from being read. On the other hand, you don't have to sync all the duplicated copies before operations such as updates are complete, which can speed things up.
Option 2 is incorrect. Even if you set strong data integrity, it can be read by multiple users at the same time. While matching the competition of each write process, the process is performed so that synchronization is successful. 
Option 3 is incorrect. The network load remains the same, but the database processing load is higher, such as synchronizing all duplicated copies before operations such as updates are complete.
Option 4 is incorrect. There is no difference in price between eventual consistency and a strong data consistency model.

•	 
Cloud Storage bucket
Explanation
Option 1 is the correct answer. Virtual machines are created in projects that are part of the resource hierarchy. Since they are located in geographic regions and data centers, they are also designated as zones. Username and administrative role are not specified during creation.
The billing account is associated with the project and does not need to be specified when the virtual machine is created. Cloud Storage buckets are created separately from virtual machines. Not all virtual machines use storage buckets.
Question 37:

Which of the following applies to the limitations of preemptible VMs?
•	 
finish within 24 hours
•	 
Not always available. Availability varies by zone and region
•	 
Unable to migrate to normal VM
•	 
all of the above
(Correct)
Explanation
Option 4 is the correct answer.
Preemptible virtual machines stop after 24 hours. Google does not guarantee the availability of Preemptible Virtual Machines. After an instance starts as a preemptible machine, it cannot be migrated to a standard virtual machine. However, you can save the snapshot and use it to create a new standard instance.

You created an Ubuntu virtual machine. You want to log into my virtual machine and install some software packages. Which network service do you use to access your virtual machine?
•	 
FTP
•	 
SSH
(Correct)
•	 
RDP
•	 
ipconfig
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer.
SSH is a service for connecting to remote servers and logging into a terminal window. After logging in, you have access to the command line. So option 2 is the correct answer.

Option 1 is incorrect. FTP is a file transfer protocol. Users cannot be logged in to perform system administrator tasks.

Option 3 is incorrect. RDP is a protocol for remote access on Windows servers, not the Linux distribution Ubuntu.

Option 4 is incorrect. ipconfig is a command-line utility for configuring a device's IP stack and does not allow login to remote servers.

Use snapshots to save a copy of the 100 GB disk. Create a snapshot and then add 10 GB of data. Create a second snapshot. What is the total amount of storage used by the two snapshots (assuming no compression)?
•	 
210 GB. 100 GB for the first snapshot, 110 GB for the second snapshot
•	 
110GB. 100 GB for the first snapshot, 10 GB for the second snapshot
(Correct)
•	 
110GB. 110 GB for second snapshot (first snapshot is automatically deleted)
•	 
221GB. 100 GB for the first snapshot, 110 GB for the second snapshot, plus 10% (11 GB) of the second snapshot for metadata overhead
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer.
When you first create a snapshot, GCP creates a full copy of your data on your persistent disk. The next time you create a snapshot from that disk, GCP will only copy the data that has changed since the previous snapshot.

Option 1 is incorrect. GCP does not store a full copy of the second snapshot.

Option 3 is incorrect. The first snapshot is not automatically deleted.

Option 4 is incorrect. Subsequent snapshots will not experience the 10% load.

•	 
GPUs
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer.
An instance group is a set of virtual machines that configure scaling and are used with a load balancer. This increases availability.

Option 1 is incorrect. Preemptible instances are not highly available because Google Cloud can shut them down at any time.

Option 3 is incorrect. Cloud Storage is not a Compute Engine component.

Option 4 is incorrect. GPUs are useful for improving throughput for compute-intensive operations, but are not relevant for high availability.
Question 42:

You work for a startup company. A major concern is cost. A small performance penalty is acceptable for cost savings. How should you configure scaling for my application running on App Engine?
•	 
Use dynamic instances with autoscaling and basic scaling
(Correct)
•	 
Use resident instances with autoscaling and basic scaling
•	 
Use dynamic instances with manual scaling
•	 
Use resident instances with manual scaling
Explanation
Option 1 is the correct answer.
Using dynamic instances with autoscaling or basic scaling automatically adjusts the number of instances to use based on load. So option 1 is the correct answer.

Option 2 is incorrect. Autoscaling and basic scaling only create dynamic instances.

Options 3 and 4 are incorrect. Manual scaling does not automatically adjust your instances. This can lead to more instances running than are needed at any given time.

When actions occur in GCP, such as writing a file to Cloud Storage or adding a message to a Cloud Pub/Sub topic, what are these actions called?
•	 
incident
•	 
event
(Correct)
•	 
trigger
•	 
log entry
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer.
These actions are called events in Google Cloud terminology.

Option 1 is incorrect. Incidents are security or performance related occurrences, but are not related to the expected standard actions that make up the event.

Option 3 is incorrect. A trigger is a declaration that a certain function will be executed when an event occurs. Log entries are related to applications that record data for important events.

Option 4 is incorrect. Log entries are useful for monitoring and compliance, but by themselves are not event-related actions.

You have stopped using Cloud Functions and would like to remove them from my project. Which command should you use from the command line to remove Cloud Functions?
•	 
gcloud functions delete
(Correct)
•	 
gcloud components function delete
•	 
gcloud components delete
•	 
gcloud delete functions
Explanation
Option 1 is the correct answer.

Option 2 is wrong because it uses components . Using components is required when installing or updating gcloud, but not when removing Cloud Functions. So options 2 and 3 are incorrect.
Option 4 is incorrect. In gcloud commands, the GCP entity type (functions in this case) precedes the operation name (delete in this case).
Question 52: 
Skipped
When specifying a Cloud Function in Cloud Storage, you must specify an event type such as finalize, delete, archive, etc. When specifying Cloud Functions in Cloud Pub/Sub, you don't need to specify the event type. Why is this.
•	 
Cloud Pub/Sub doesn't have event type triggers
•	 
Cloud Pub/Sub can only trigger one type of event when publishing a message.
(Correct)
•	 
Cloud Pub/Sub analyzes your function code to determine the correct event type.
•	 
Problem statement is incorrect. Cloud Pub/Sub functions also need to specify the event type
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer.
This is the only type of event that is triggered in Cloud Pub/Sub and is triggered when a message is published. So option 2 is the correct answer.

Option 1 is incorrect. Cloud Pub/Sub can trigger one event type.

Option 3 is incorrect. Cloud Pub/Sub does not analyze your code to determine when to run it.

Option 4 is incorrect. You don't need to specify the event type in your Cloud Pub/Sub function.

A software developer on their team wants your help to improve the query performance of their database application. A developer is using a Second Generation instance of Cloud SQL MySQL. Which option do you recommend?
•	 
Mercorystore and SSD persistent disks
(Correct)
•	 
Memorystore and HDD Persistent Disk
•	 
Datastore and SSD Persistent Disk
•	 
Datastore and HDD Persistent Disk
Explanation
Option 1 is the correct answer.
Mercorystore is a managed Redis cache. A cache can be used to store the results of queries. Queries that reference cached data can read data from the cache. This method is significantly faster than reading from persistent disk. SSD latency is significantly reduced over hard disk drives. SSDs are used in performance critical applications such as databases.

Options 2 and 4 are incorrect. HDD persistent disks provide the best performance in terms of IOPS.

Options 3 and 4 are incorrect. The data store is a managed NoSQL database and does not impact SQL query performance.

Which statement is incorrect about Cloud Storage?
•	 
Cloud Storage buckets can have retention periods
•	 
Lifecycle configuration can be used to change the storage class from Regional to Multi-Regional
(Correct)
•	 
Cloud Scorage does not provide block-level access to data in files stored in buckets
•	 
Cloud Storage is designed for durability
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer.
A lifecycle configuration can change the storage class from Regional to Nearline or Coldfine. Once a bucket is created as Regional or Multi-Regional, it cannot be changed to Multi-Regional or Regional. Option 2 is the correct answer.

Option 1 is correct, so it is the wrong choice. You can set the retention period when creating a bucket.

Option 3 is correct, so it is the wrong choice. Cloud Storage does not provide a file system, including access to internal data blocks.

Option 4 is correct, so it is the wrong choice. Cloud Storage is highly durable.

When you enter your query in the BigQuery query form, BigQuery analyzes your query.
What metric estimates are displayed?
•	 
Time required to enter query
•	 
query cost
•	 
amount of data scanned
(Correct)
•	 
Bytes passed between servers in a BigQuery cluster
Explanation
Option 3 is the correct answer.
BigQuery displays an estimate of the amount of data scanned. This is important because BigQuery charges for the data scanned by the query.

Option 1 is incorrect. Knowing how long it takes to enter a query is not useful.

Option 2 is incorrect. To estimate costs, you should use estimates of scanned data and pricing calculators.

Option 4 is incorrect. BigQuery does not create clusters, unlike Dataproc. No network I/O data is displayed.

•	 
1 metadata file
•	 
Folder with one metadata file and data
(Correct)
•	 
Folders with one metadata file, entity files, and data
Explanation
Option 3 is the correct answer.
The export process creates a metadata file containing information about the exported data and a folder containing the data. So option 3 is the correct answer.

•	 
gcloud create container clusters name udemy-cluster --num-nodes = 2
•	 
gcloud beta container clusters create udemy-cluster --num-nodes = 2
(Correct)
Explanation
Option 4 is the correct answer. You can create a cluster based on two nodes with the command gcloud beta container clusters create udemy-cluster --num-nodes = 2. Use the gcloud beta container clusters create [cluster name] command to create a cluster with this name. You can set the number of nodes with the additional command'--num-nodes = 2'.
Option 1 is incorrect. gcloud create container clusters name udemy-cluster --num-nodes : 2 is not a valid command. Must be gcloud beta container clusters create udemy-cluster. Also, in the node settings, add --num-nodes = 2 and the command.
Option 2 is incorrect. In the node settings, add --num-nodes = 2 and the command.
Option 3 is incorrect. gcloud create container clusters name udemy-cluster --num-nodes : 2 is not a valid command. Must be gcloud beta container clusters create udemy-cluster.

You are using Cloud DNS to set up your domain to publish your web application to the Internet. You need to store canonical name information.
Which record should you set?
•	 
CNAME record
(Correct)
•	 
AAAA record
•	 
MX record
•	 
A record
Explanation
Option 1 is the correct answer. A CNAME record is a record that defines an alias for a domain name or host name defined in DNS. Map the alias name as canonical name information to the CNAME record.
CNAME records are typically used to map a subdomain, such as www or mail, to the domain that hosts the content of that subdomain. For example, you can use a CNAME record to map the web address www.example.com to the actual website in the domain example.com.
Options 2 and 4 are incorrect. AAAA records and A records store domain name-to-IP address mappings.
Option 3 is incorrect. An MX record is a resource record that indicates a domain's mail exchange server.
Question 67:

You are implementing a web application on Google Cloud. You plan to use a VM for the WEB server and configure a Cloud Storage bucket for the data layer. The VM needs to read an object from the Cloud Storage bucket. This read operation is allowed by the IAM role granted to the VM's service account, but is denied in the scope assigned to the VM.
Can this VM perform bucket reads?
•	 
If approved on the bucket side, a read can be executed.
•	 
The read is not performed.
(Correct)
•	 
The read is performed.
•	 
A read is performed, but an error occurs on the bucket side.
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer. To read an object in a Cloud Storage bucket from a VM, both the scope assigned to the service account and the IAM role must allow operations for the read process to succeed. Therefore, in this case, the scope permission cannot be set and the read process from the VM cannot be executed. When you set up a new instance to run as a service account, the IAM role you assign to the service account specifies the access level for the service account.
If a service account does not have an IAM role, there are no API methods that you can run against the instance in that service account. In addition, the access scope of an instance defines the default OAuth scope for requests made using the gcloud tools and client libraries on that instance. As a result, access to API methods may be further restricted when authenticating with OAuth.

•	 
Image
(Correct)
•	 
Type
•	 
Name
•	 
Properties
Explanation
Option 1 is the correct answer. image is not a basic component of Deployment Manager. Configuration with Deployment Manager describes all the resources needed for a single deployment. A configuration is a YAML-formatted file that lists the resources you create and their properties, respectively.  A section is required and includes a list of resources to create here. Each resource you deploy with Deployment Manager must contain three components:
■ name
A user-defined string to identify the resource (my-vm, project-data-disk, the-test-network, etc.).
■ type
The type of resource to be deployed (compute.v1.instance, compute.v1.disk, and so on). Basic resource types are listed and described in Supported Resource Types. 
■ properties
Resource type parameter. The value must match one of the resource type properties (for example, zone: asia-east1-a boot: true).

Which of the following elements cannot be specified in the alert policy?
•	 
conditions
•	 
notification
•	 
document
•	 
Duration
(Correct)
Explanation
Option 4 is the wrong element and so is the correct answer. You can specify conditions, notifications, and documents when you create an alert policy. The duration cannot be set.
Option 1 is the correct configuration element. The condition describes the resource to be monitored, the index of the resource, and the timing when the condition is satisfied. An alert policy requires at least one condition, but an alert policy can contain up to six conditions.
Option 2 is the correct setting element. Notifications lists whether you have configured this policy to notify you when an incident is opened and closed, or whether you have configured it to notify you only when an incident is opened. To change the notification behavior, edit the alert policy.
Option 3 is the correct setting element. "Document" can specify the document to be included in the notification.

The development team will use the Compute Engine to utilize the VM. Therefore, you want to estimate the cost of using a VM.
Select the elements that do not affect the price of the VM from the following.
•	 
Server execution time
•	 
Instance type selected
•	 
Region where the server is installed
•	 
Zone where the server is installed
(Correct)
Explanation
Option 4 is the correct answer because it is an incorrect billing factor. The cost of a Compute Engine VM is affected by server characteristics such as the number of virtual servers, the amount of memory, and the region in which the virtual machine runs, but the zone in which the server is installed does not affect the cost.
Option 1 is the correct billing factor. All ComputeEngine vCPUs, GPUs, and GB memories are charged for at least one minute. For example, if you run a virtual machine for 30 seconds, you will be charged for 1 minute. After the first minute, your instance will be charged per second.
Option 2 is the correct billing factor. For example, VM generic machine types have predefined machine types and custom machine types available in each region. The predefined machine types have preset vCPU numbers and memory capacities, while custom machine types are billed according to resource-based pricing.
Option 3 is the correct billing factor. VMs are priced differently depending on the region, so the region you deploy determines the price.

gcloud compute instances set-service-account
(Correct)
•	 
gcloud compute instances add-access-config
•	 
gcloud compute instances get-iam-policy
•	 
gcloud compute instances create
Explanation
Option 1 is the correct answer. The correct command to use when setting the scope of a virtual server is gcloud compute instances set-service-account. Gcloud compute instances are commands for reading and manipulating ComputeEngine virtual machine instances. Set the Compute Engine service account and access scope by using gcloud compute instances set-service-account.
Option 2 is incorrect. gcloud compute instances add-access-config creates a ComputeEngine virtual machine access configuration. It does not include access scope.
Option 3 is incorrect. gcloud compute instances get-iam-policy gets the IAM policy for your Compute Engine instance.
Option 4 is incorrect. gcloud compute instances create creates ComputeEngine virtual machine instances.

Set up SMS, Slack, and email in operation alerts
Explanation
Option 1 is the correct answer. As a way to notify team members when something goes wrong on your Kubernetes cluster, you can use the notifications feature of the Operations Suite to set up SMS, Slack, and email. When you enable integration of Cloud Operations for GKE with Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring in your cluster, logs are stored in a dedicated persistent data store. This allows you to take advantage of Cloud Monitoring's operational suite to set up notifications via SMS, Slack, and email.
Option 2 is incorrect. Stackdriver alerts are an older feature of the Operations Suite and now run in the Operations Suite.
Option 3 is incorrect. The Operation Suite Agent is a function that is installed in a virtual machine and used to acquire log information.
Option 4 is incorrect. There is no function called operation alert. You can set SMS, Slack, and Email in the monitoring settings in the Operations Suite.

You are setting up to develop a container application that leverages a Kubernetes cluster. It is necessary to duplicate each node pool into three zones in the control plane region.
How should you configure the cluster?
•	 
Use a multi-zone cluster in Autopilot mode.
•	 
Use a multi-zone cluster in Standard mode.
•	 
Use a region cluster in Standard mode.
(Correct)
•	 
Use a region cluster in Autopilot mode.
Explanation
Option 3 is the correct answer. You can use a region cluster in Standard mode to replicate each node pool to three zones in the control plane region.
When you create a Kubernetes cluster, choose one of the following operational modes:
Autopilot: Provides a fully provisioned managed cluster configuration. Cluster configuration options are automatically created for clusters created in Autopilot mode. Autopilot clusters are preconfigured with an optimized cluster configuration for production workloads.
Standard: Provides a high degree of configuration flexibility for the underlying infrastructure of the cluster. For clusters created using Standard mode, users determine the configuration required for production workloads. In Autopilot mode, a highly available configuration using regions is automatically applied, but in Standard mode, you can select a configuration using regions or zones from the following: 
■ Single zone cluster A single zone cluster contains one control plane operating in one zone. This control plane manages workloads on nodes running in the same zone. 
■ Multi-zone cluster A multi-zone cluster contains one replica of the control plane operating in one zone and multiple nodes operating in multiple zones. The workload continues to operate during cluster upgrades and when the zone in which the control plane operates is down. However, you cannot configure the cluster or the nodes and workloads within it until the control plane is available. Multi-zone clusters provide a consistent workload while balancing availability and cost. 
■ Region cluster A region cluster contains multiple replicas operating in multiple zones within a particular region. Nodes in a region cluster can run in multiple zones or a single zone, depending on the location of the configured nodes. By default, GKE replicates each node pool into three zones in the control plane region. When you create a cluster or add a new node pool, you can change the default configuration by specifying the zone in which the nodes of the cluster run. All zones must be in the same region as the control plane. 
Options 1 and 4 are incorrect. In Autopilot mode, highly available regional configurations are automatically applied. Therefore, you cannot select the cluster configuration.
Option 2 is incorrect. A multi-zone cluster contains one replica of the control plane operating in one zone and multiple nodes operating in multiple zones, but the redundancy of replicating the nodes into three zones is guaranteed.

•	 
K_SERVICE environment variable
•	 
K_Configuration environment variable
(Correct)
•	 
K_REVISION environment variable
•	 
CloudRun metadata
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer. Name information such as containers in the Cloud Run configuration is stored in the K_Configuration environment variable. When Cloud Run starts the container, K_Configuration, K_Revision, K_Service, and Port are created as environment variables. In K_Configuration, specify the configuration in which the container was created. If you use a Docker container, use the CMD command in your Dockerfile configuration to specify the command to run at startup.
Option 1 is incorrect. Contains the name of the Cloud Run service that is running.
Option 3 is incorrect. Contains the name of the Cloud Run revision that is running.
Option 4 is incorrect. There is no configuration file called CloudRun metadata.

You are using Compute Engine to start multiple VMs and need VM management.
Which of the following is an efficient setting to get data about CPU load from all instances every 5 minutes?
•	 
Monitor the VM's load_5m metric on the default monitoring screen of the operations suite.
•	 
Install the Monitoring agent on the VM to monitor the load_5m metrics.
(Correct)
•	 
Enable monitoring of the operations suite to monitor the load_5m metrics of the VM.
•	 
Install a monitoring script using the operation suite on the VM to monitor the load_5m metric.
Explanation
Option 2 is the correct answer. The Monitoring agent collects system and application metrics from virtual machine instances and sends the collected information to Cloud Monitoring. By default, the Monitoring agent collects disk, CPU, network, and process metrics. To monitor third-party applications. You need to configure the Monitoring agent for the server to get the agent metrics.
When you configure the Monitoring agent, the load_5m metric allows you to retrieve data about the CPU load from your instance every 5 minutes.

You took a snapshot of a persistent disk with 10GB in use a few hours ago. An additional 5GB of data has been added to this persistent disk. Then you took the snapshot again. These snapshots are stored in a dedicated bucket and are costly depending on the amount of data.
What is the amount of data in the snapshot you added?
•	 
10GB
•	 
15GB
•	 
5GB
(Correct)
•	 
20GB
Explanation
Option 3 is the correct answer. Persistent disk snapshots only save increments from previous snapshots. Therefore, if you add another 5GB of data to the persistent disk and then take the snapshot again, only the additional 5GB will be taken as a snapshot.
The Compute Engine uses delta snapshots, so each snapshot contains only the data that has changed since the last snapshot. Deleting a snapshot does not delete all the data on that snapshot, because later snapshots may require the information stored in the previous snapshot.

You are preparing to develop a new application using Google Cloud. In this configuration, you will use two VPCs with multiple subnets.
How many CIDRs do you need to define?
•	 
Set one CIDR for each subnet.
(Correct)
•	 
Set one CIDR for each region.
•	 
Set one CIDR for each VPC.
•	 
You can set one or more CIDRs for each zone.
Explanation
Option 1 is the correct answer. CIDR must be configured one for each subnet. This allows you to specify the number of IP addresses assigned within the subnet and the subnet range. In Google Cloud, your VPC is globally configured and has subnets within the region. Therefore, you don't need to assign an IP address range to your VPC, you only assign an IP address range to your subnet.
Option 2 is incorrect. You need to set CIDR for each subnet, not for each region. Regions are not networks, they are geographical areas and are not subject to CIDR. 
Option 3 is incorrect. You don't have to assign an IP address range to your VPC, just a subnet.
Option 4 is incorrect. You need to set CIDR for each subnet, not for each zone. Zones are a collection of data centers, not networks, and are not subject to CIDR.

You are managing instances on Compute Engine. Because some images have been deprecated, it is necessary to notify the user that the corresponding image will be deprecated.
What is the appropriate method for this?
•	 
Stop the image.
•	 
Delete the image so that it cannot be viewed.
•	 
Mark deprecated images
(Correct)
•	 
Increase the image version.
Explanation
Option 3 is the correct answer. If you set the status of the image to "DEPRECATED", you can still continue to use the image to create VMs, but you will get a warning. The purpose is to notify the user that the image is obsolete, not to delete the image itself. Because of this, you need to identify that the image will be obsolete while still making it available.
Option 1 is incorrect. Prohibiting access to an image is not appropriate as it will suddenly prevent users from creating VMs using this image. This does not serve the purpose of notifying.
Option 2 is incorrect. Deleting an image is not appropriate as it will suddenly prevent users from creating VMs with this image. This does not serve the purpose of notifying.
Option 4 is incorrect. Increasing the version of the image does not notify the user that the image is obsolete.

Your team wants to store audit logs for log term users and they want to give read only access to external auditors for this log data.
As per best practices of giving least privilege access, what solutions will you suggest for your team? Choose 2 correct choices.
•	 
Configure Cloud Storage Bucket as export sink for audit logs
(Correct)
•	 
Configure BigQuery  as export sink for audit logs
•	 
Create a  group for all auditors
Give view access to this group for Cloud Logging.
•	 
Create a signed URL to the Cloud export destination for auditors to access.
(Correct)
Explanation
There are 3 type of export destinations for Cloud Logs to:
> Cloud Storage
> Cloud Pub/Sub
> BigQuery.
BigQuery can be used as sink for exporting the logs but it is not cost effective for long term storage. Better solution will be to export the logs to Cloud Storage Bucket and then use BigQuery to run any analysis job on this data. BigQuery can read data stored in Cloud Storage Bucket.

You can give read only access either by creating a Group for auditor and giving permissions via ACL to access object for this group or you can control access via signed URL's.
Since your team wants to give read only access for external auditors, so signed URL is better choice

However in next quarter due to festival season, your company is expecting a very high load on this application.
What testing strategy will you suggest in this case to ensure the system maintains the SLA during festival season as well?
•	 
Capture existing users input and replay captured user load multiple times.
Increase group's size each day until autoscale logic is triggered on all layers.
At the same time, terminate random resources on both zones.
•	 
Create customized random user input.
Replay customized load until autoscale logic is triggered on at least one layer
At the same time, terminate random resources on both zones.
(Correct)
•

You development team want to store all server events to GCS Bucket for some analysis.
The event records size can vary from 100 KB to 20 MB and are expected to peak at 3,000 events per second.
How can you minimize data loss. Which process should you implement?
•	 
Append metadata to file body.
Compress individual files.
Name files with a random prefix pattern.
Save files to one bucket
(Correct)
•	 
Batch every 3000 events with a single manifest file for metadata.
Compress event files and manifest file into a single archive file.
Name files using serverName-EventSequence pattern.
Create a new bucket if bucket is older than 1 day and save the single archive file to the new bucket. Otherwise, save the single archive file to existing bucket.
•	 
Compress individual files.
Name files with serverName-EventSequence pattern.
Save files to one bucket
Set custom metadata headers for each object after saving.
•	 
Append metadata to file body.
Compress individual files.
Name files with serverName-Timestamp pattern.
Create a new bucket if bucket is older than 1 hour and save individual files to the new bucket. Otherwise, save files to existing bucket
Explanation
Avoid using sequential object names such as timestamp-based object names if you are uploading many objects in parallel. Objects with sequential names are stored consecutively, so they are likely to hit the same backend server. When this happens, throughput is constrained. In order to achieve optimal throughput, add the hash of the sequence number as part of the object name to make it non-sequential
Compressing and combining smaller files info fewer larger files is also a best practice for speeding up transfer speeds because it saves network bandwidth and space in Google Cloud Storage.

What is the best practice for separating responsibilities and access for production and development environments?
•	 
Separate project for each environment, each team only has access to their project.
(Correct)
•	 
Separate project for each environment, both teams have access to both projects
•	 
Both environments use the same project, but different VPC's.
•	 
Both environments use the same project, just note which resources are in use by which group.
Explanation
As best practices:
• Separate account must be used for each environment which is associated with different group of users. You should use project to isolate user access to resource, and not to manage users.
• Shared VPC allows each team to individually manage their own application resources, while enabling each application to communicate between each other securely over RFC1918 address space.
VPC is used for securing communication and not for resource isolation. Project must be used for resource isolation.

To increase its revenue, your team wants to convert free users into paid users. For this your team needs to send some promotional message to all free users.
You team is not sure about click-through rate for such promotional mail. It could vary between 500 click to 1 million click in a day.
What solution will you suggest for your team in this case?
•	 
Store user information in Cloud SQL
Use Google Compute Engine VM instance to host web application.
•	 
Use Cloud Datastore to store user data
Use App Engine to host web application
(Correct)
•	 
Store user information in Cloud SQL
Use Cloud Function to host Web Application
•	 
Use Cloud Datastore to store user data
Use Cloud Function to host Web Application
Explanation
Cloud Datastore is more appropriate to store User Data. Datastore is a highly scalable NoSQL database for your applications. Datastore automatically handles sharding and replication, providing you with a highly available and durable database that scales automatically to handle your applications load. Datastore provides a myriad of capabilities such as ACID transactions, SQL-like queries, indexes, and much more.

Also single VM instance will not be able to handle very high click through rate. In case of high traffic we need autoscaling solution. So App Engine is most appropriate choice among all given options.

Cloud Function is good for event driven processing rather than hosting web application.

Your team has created an autoscaling instance group to serve web traffic for an application. This instance group is used as backend service for HTTP(S) load balancer.
But you noticed that this deployment configuration is not working as expected. All virtual machine (VM) instances in instance group are being terminated and re-launched every minute. Public IP address is not assigned to any instance. You are getting correct response from each instance using the curl command.
How can you fix above problem?
•	 
Make sure that a firewall rule exists to allow source traffic on HTTP(S) to reach the load balancer.
•	 
Assign a public IP to each instance.
Add a firewall rule in VPC to allow HTTP(s) traffic from load balancer to instance public IP.
•	 
Ensure that a firewall rule exists to allow load balancer health checks to reach the instances in the instance group.
(Correct)
•	 
Create a network tag for the load balancer.
Create another network tag for VM instances.
Configure a firewall rule to allow HTTP(S) traffic with above created load balancer network tag as the source and the instance network tag as the destination.
Explanation
Option C is correct here. Since instances are getting terminated and relaunched, it means load balancer is considering instance to be unhealthy. It could be because load balancer is not able to reach to compute engine instance.
So to fix this, we must ensure that a firewall rule exists to allow load balancer health checks to reach the instances in the instance group.

Your team has hosted a web application to serve static content on Google Compute Engine using Managed Instance Group. Your team wants to use Cloud CDN to reduce latency for the customer.
What suggestion can you give to your team to improvise the cache hit ratio?
•	 
Do customization in cache key to remove the protocol information
(Correct)
•	 
Use very short expiration duration
•	 
Add header HTTP(S) header (Cache-Region) in request that points to the closest region for the application customer.
•	 
Serve static content from Cloud Storage bucket. Use Global Load Balancer with Cloud Storage Bucket as its backend service.
Explanation
By using short expiration duration for key will decrease the cache hit ratio
Cloud CDN does not handle header Cache-Region. So there is no point in using any such header.
Cloud storage bucket is slower than CDN in serving content
So only Option A is correct choice here. This both Http and Https will use same key.
By default, Cloud CDN uses the complete request URL to build the cache key. For performance and scalability, it’s important to optimize cache hit ratio. To help optimize your cache hit ratio, you can use custom cache keys .

You have created 4 snapshots of your Compute Engine VM instance boot disk. By mistake snapshot 2 and snapshot 3 were deleted. What will happen to 4th snapshot now?
•	 
Data from snapshot 3, necessary for continuance, will be transferred to snapshot 4. 
(Correct)
•	 
Snapshot 4 can not be used any more.
•	 
All later snapshots, including Snapshot 4, are automatically deleted as well.
•	 
The data from snapshot 3 necessary for continuance will be transferred to snapshot 4, however snapshot 2's contents were transferred to snapshot 1.
Explanation
When you delete a snapshot, Compute Engine immediately marks the snapshot as DELETED in the system. If the snapshot has no dependent snapshots, it is deleted outright. However, if the snapshot does have dependent snapshots:
1) Any data that is required for restoring other snapshots is moved into the next snapshot, increasing its size.
2) Any data that is not required for restoring other snapshots is deleted. This lowers the total size of all your snapshots.
3) The next snapshot no longer references the snapshot marked for deletion, and instead references the snapshot before it.
Deleting a snapshot does not necessarily delete all the data on the snapshot. If any data on a snapshot that is marked for deletion is needed for restoring subsequent snapshots, that data is moved into the next corresponding snapshot. To definitively delete data from your snapshots, you should delete all snapshots.

Pub/Sub Message Ordering (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/ordering)
If messages have the same ordering key and are in the same region, you can enable message ordering and receive the messages in the order that the Pub/Sub service receives them.
Pub/Sub delivers each message at least once, so the Pub/Sub service might redeliver messages. When you receive messages in order and the Pub/Sub service redelivers a message with an ordering key, Pub/Sub maintains order by also redelivering the subsequent messages with the same ordering key. The Pub/Sub service redelivers these messages in the order that it originally received them.

Configure each sensor to poll Cloud Pub/Sub for the connectivity and publish data in a shared topic.
(Correct)
•	 
Allow sensors to store data directly into Cloud Datastore.
•	 
Allow sensors to invoke Cloud Function and Cloud Function in turn will send data to your application.
Explanation
Cloud Pub/Sub is Google Managed service that can easily support data ingestion at any scale, so Option B is correct choice here.
Question 49: 
Skipped
Your company has developed a web crawling application written in C++. This application hits the URL and process the response content.

•	 
Use OAuth2.0
(Correct)
•	 
Use SAML2.0
•	 
Develop custom Single Sign On Application and deploy it in Compute Engine Instances.
•	 
Create a service account with required access to invoke your application API.
3rd party services should use this service account
Explanation
OAuth2.0 is industry standard protocol for delegated authorization.

Question 1: Incorrect
In your company, there is one application that is running on Compute Engine VM instances having Linux operation system. These VM instances are launched using managed instance group. This application is facing some performance issues on one of the VM instance that host this application and you need to find the cause of this performance issue.
You observed that when application is under heavy load, then some application requests are getting dropped and there is a single application process that is consuming all the available CPU on misbehaving instance.
Autoscaling of VM instance has reached the upper limit of instances and there is normal load on all other related systems. Database is also working fine.
To solve this production issue, what can you suggest?
•	 
Create an autoscaling metric based on percentage of memory used and use this metric to do autoscaling
•	 
Restart the misbehaving instances on a regular scheduled basis.
•	 
Increase the maximum number of instances limit in the autoscaling group.
(Correct)
•	 
Login the misbehaving instance via SSH connection and restart the application process.
(Incorrect)
Explanation
Since existing application instances are using full CPU and autoscaling maximum limit is also reached, so to enable more processing, maximum limit of autoscaling group must be increased.
This way it will create more compute engine instance to handle increasing load on existing application infrastructure.
Question 2: Correct
Your company has an application that performs some complex calculation. This application exposes web API for these calculations. Currently this application runs on a single GKE cluster in us-central1 region only.
Now based on the demand of the application, Your company want to expand its business and need to offer Web API to its customers in Asia region as well.
As Google Cloud architect, What solution would you like to suggest?
•	 
Create a second GKE cluster in Asia region.
Use service of type LoadBalancer to expose web API from both regions.
Add the public IP address to the Cloud DNS zone.
(Correct)
•	 
Use global HTTP(s) load balancer
•	 
Increase the memory and computation capacity in same GKE cluster.
•	 
Create a second GKE cluster in Asia region.
Create a global HTTP(s) Load Balancer via kubectl.
Explanation
When you create a Service of type LoadBalancer, a Google Cloud controller wakes up and configures a network load balancer in your project. The load balancer has a stable IP address that is accessible from outside of your project.

Note that a network load balancer is not a proxy server. It forwards packets with no change to the source and destination IP addresses.

Question 5: Correct
Your company want to run multiple VM instances in one VPC without public IP address assigned to any VM. There in no connection between on-premises data center and Google cloud.
How can any team member in your company can connect to VM instance via SSH connection in such case?
•	 
Configure Cloud NAT in each subnet of VPC where the VM is hosted.
First connect to Cloud NAT IP via SSH and then connect to VM instances in VPC.
•	 
Create an Unmanaged Instance Group.
Add all instances in to above group.
Use this instance group as backed for TCP load balancer.
Use TCP load balancer IP to connect to VM instances in VPC.
•	 
Create a bastion host in same VPC network.
Assign public IP to this bastion host VM instance.
Start the bastion host when team member need to connect to VMs with private IP in your VPC.
Connect to bastion host via SSH using public IP of bastion host.
Connect to other VMs via SSH using their private IP from this bastion host.
Stop the bastion host after work is done.
(Correct)
•	 
Use Private Google Access to connect to VMs via their private IP 
Explanation
Bastion hosts provide an external facing point of entry into a network containing private network instances. This host can provide a single point of fortification or audit and can be started and stopped to enable or disable inbound SSH. By using a bastion host, you can connect to an VM that does not have an external IP address. This approach allows you to connect to a development environment or manage the database instance for your external application without configuring additional firewall rules.

Compare the hashes.
•	 
Upload all the files to GCS bucket via gsutil -m command.
Download the uploaded files via gsutil cp command .
Use Linux diff command to compare the files content.
(Incorrect)
•	 
Use Linux shasum to compute a digest of the files in on-premises data center.
Upload all the files to GCS bucket via gsutil -m command.
Download the uploaded files via gsutil cp command .
Use Linux shasum to compute a digest of the downloaded files.
Compare the hashes.
•	 
Upload all the files to GCS bucket via gsutil -m command.
Calculate CRC32C hashes of all on premise files via gsutil hash -c FILE_NAME.
Collect CRC32C hashes of uploaded files via gsutil ls -L gs://[YOUR_BUCKET_NAME}.
Compare the hashes.
(Correct)
Explanation
1.	gsutil -m 
It allows to upload files in parallel using multithreading.
1.	gsutil hash [-c] [-h] [-m] filename...
The hash command calculates hashes on a local file that can be used to compare with gsutil ls -L output. If a specific hash option is not provided, this command calculates all gsutil-supported hashes for the file.

Question 7: Incorrect
You want to deploy application using microservice architecture in GKE but you do not want to expose these microservices end points to external world. All these microservices will be used inside cluster only. All these microservice can have different number of replicas.
Now suggest a way so that all these microservices can communicate with each other in uniform and consistent manner. 
•	 
Create Deployment for each microservice to deploy in GKE cluster.
Use Service to expose the deployment in the cluster.
One microservices should talk to other microservice in cluster via Service DNS name.
(Correct)
•	 
Create Deployment for each microservice to deploy in GKE cluster.
Use Ingress to expose the deployment in the cluster.
One microservice should talk to other microservice in cluster via Ingress IP address.
(Incorrect)
•	 
Create Pod for each microservice to deploy in GKE cluster.
Use Service to expose the deployment in the cluster.
One microservices should talk to other microservice in cluster via Service DNS name.
•	 
Create Pod for each microservice to deploy in GKE cluster.
Use Ingress to expose the deployment in the cluster.
One microservice should talk to other microservice in cluster via Ingress IP address.
Explanation
Deployments represent a set of multiple, identical Pods with no unique identities. A Deployment runs multiple replicas of your application and automatically replaces any instances that fail or become unresponsive. In this way, Deployments help ensure that one or more instances of your application are available to serve user requests. Deployments are managed by the Kubernetes Deployment controller.
In GKE, Service is use to group a set of Pod endpoints into a single resource. You can configure various ways to access the grouping. By default, you get a stable cluster IP address that clients inside the cluster can use to contact Pods in the Service. A client sends a request to the stable IP address, and the request is routed to one of the Pods in the Service.
A Service also provides load balancing. Clients call a single, stable IP address, and their requests are balanced across the Pods that are members of the Service.

Question 8: Correct
Your company has applications that processes some sensitive data for its clients. You want to migrate such application onto Google Cloud.
As per your company policies, all the applications should run on physically separated hardware. There is also a requirement that workloads of different clients can not run on same machine.
As Google Cloud architect, you used a sole tenant node group and created a node for each client. 
How can you meet the requirement to deploy the workloads of each client on the host machine dedicated to respective host.
•	 
Create an organization policy that does not allow any two applications to run on same VM host machine.
•	 
While creating VM instances associate different network tags based on node group name with VM instances to make sure that workload of each client is deployed on the host machine dedicated to respective host.
•	 
While creating VM instances use node affinity labels based on the node group to make sure that workloads of each client is deployed on the host machine dedicated to respective host.
•	 
While creating VM instances use node affinity labels based on the node name to make sure that workloads of each client is deployed on the host machine dedicated to respective host.
(Correct)
Explanation
For dedicated hardware, we  must go with sole tenant node. Sole-tenancy lets you have exclusive access to a sole-tenant node, which is a physical Compute Engine server that is dedicated to hosting only your project's VMs. Use sole-tenant nodes to keep your VMs physically separated from VMs in other projects, or to group your VMs together on the same host hardware
 

Within a sole-tenant node, you can provision multiple VMs on machine types of various sizes, which lets you efficiently use the underlying resources of the dedicated host hardware. Also, because you aren't sharing the host hardware with other projects, you can meet security or compliance requirements with workloads that require physical isolation from other workloads or VMs.

Affinity labels let you logically group nodes and node groups, and later, when provisioning VMs, you can specify affinity labels on the VMs to schedule VMs on a specific set of nodes or node groups

When you create a VM, you request sole-tenancy by specifying node affinity or anti-affinity, referencing one or more node affinity labels. You specify custom node affinity labels when you create a node template, and Compute Engine automatically includes some default affinity labels on each node. By specifying affinity when you create a VM, you can schedule VMs together on a specific node or nodes in a node group. By specifying anti-affinity when you create a VM, you can ensure that certain VMs are not scheduled together on the same node or nodes in a node group.

You can create custom node affinity labels when you create a node template. These affinity labels are assigned to all nodes in node groups created from the node template. You can't add more custom affinity labels to nodes in a node group after the node group has been created.

Provisioning a VM on a sole-tenant node requires the following:
Creating a sole-tenant node template. The sole-tenant node template specifies uniform properties for all of the sole-tenant nodes in a sole-tenant node group.
Creating a sole-tenant node group using the previously created sole-tenant node template.
Creating VMs and provisioning them on a sole-tenant node group.

Question 9: Correct
Your company has a monolithic application. This application has lots of issues in terms of reliability, and being a monolithic application, it is difficult to do any enhancements in this application.
Now this team want to break this monolithic application into multiple microservices but they want to minimize the operation overhead of microservice architecture. So this team is more interested in using fully managed service for this microservice architecture.
How can this team convince their top management to provide approval for this transition from monolithic to microservice architecture. What are the advantages that this team can highlight?
•	 
Microservice architecture will decouple infrastructure from application.
Development and release cycle of new features will become easy.
Infrastructure management will become easier by using managed service in cloud.
It is easy to set up CI/CD pipeline for each microservice in cloud.
A/B testing can be done easily for each microservice.
Microservices are easy to scale.
(Correct)
•	 
Docker image can be created for monolithic application.
This docker image can be easily deployed in Kubernetes cluster.
•	 
VM instances can be easily migrated to cloud in automated manner and it will be cost effective as well
•	 
Microservice will cost less in cloud as compare to monolithic.
Infrastructure management will become easier.
Explanation
All the reason mentioned in choice A are obvious advantages of using microservice.

Question 10: Incorrect
You need to migrate your application running in on-premises data center to Google Cloud. You are not able to select right machine configuration in terms of CPU and memory in cloud. In on-premises data center this application was optimally configured for efficient usage of resources. This application has been getting used uniformly throughout the week since multiple weeks.
As Google Cloud architect how can you optimize the resource usage of VM instance running in cloud?
You also need to take care of costing of VM as well.
•	 
Select the machine type having CPU and memory configuration similar to on-premises instance.
Use this machine type to create VM instance in Google Cloud.
Configure the Cloud Monitoring agent and deploy the third party application on these VM instances.
Do load testing of your application in cloud for usual traffic that you were getting in on-premises data center.
Follow the recommendations shown in Cloud Console for rightsizing of the VM instances running in cloud..
(Correct)
•	 
Create multiple compute engine instances with varying CPU and memory options.
Configure the Cloud Monitoring agent and deploy the third party application on these VM instances.
Do load testing of your application in cloud for peak traffic.
Use  load testing results to tune in the configuration of CPU and memory
•	 
Create an image of the third-party application running in on-premises virtual machine.
Create an instance template with the smallest available machine type that use image created in previous step.
Create a managed instance group.
Use average CPU utilization to autoscale the number of instances in the group.
Optimize the number of instances running based on the average CPU utilization threshold.
(Incorrect)
•	 
Use App Engine Flexible environment to deploy the third-party application using a Dockerfile.
Configure CPU and memory options similar to your application's current on-premises virtual machine in the app.yaml file
Explanation
Since this application is already configured in optimal manner in on-premises data center so it make sense to use similar configurations in GCP as well. So Option A looks like the right option.
Option B is incorrect because we can not create a VM with varying number of CPU and memory.
Option C look incorrect because only CPU is considered for optimal configuration of application.
Option D is not correct because it is a simple lift and shift approach to migrate to cloud. In this case, first application might need to be containerized using Docker. This is an extra development effort so this is not preferred.
Question 11: Incorrect
You need to run an application on Compute Engine VM instance in GCP that use Ubuntu Linux operating system. This application needs very complex configurations in order to run it properly.
How can you ensure that you can install Ubuntu distribution updates with minimal manual intervention whenever such update is available.?
•	 
Create a Compute Engine instance using a latest image of Ubuntu Linux operating system.
Install and configure the application on this VM.
Use OS patch management to install available updates.
•	 
Create a Compute Engine instance template using a latest image of Ubuntu Linux operating system.
Create an instance from this template.
Install and configure the application as part of the startup script.
Repeat the process whenever a new Google-managed Ubuntu image becomes available
(Correct)
•	 
Create a Compute Engine instance using a latest image of Ubuntu Linux operating system.
Install and configure the application on the instance after connecting to this instance via SSH.
Repeat this process whenever a new Google Cloud managed Ubuntu image becomes available
(Incorrect)
•	 
Create a Docker container image with Ubuntu as the base image.
Install and configure the application as part of Docker image creation process.
Host the container on GKE.
Restart the container whenever a new update is available.
Explanation
Option A and Option C, are incorrect because in both options, application configurations has to be done manually again and again with release of new Ubuntu Image. Since application configuration is very extensive, so manual configuration of application repeatedly is not the right choice. It is both time consuming and error prone because there can be some mistake in doing the manual configuration.

Option D, is incorrect because it requires to create a Docker image that contains both OS and application configuration. It is not a good idea to have OS in docker image. In addition to this, creating a docker image is additional development effort as well.

Option B is the correct choice because in this option Startup Script is used to install and configure application. Startup Script execution is an automated process which will be executed automatically whenever new instance is created.
With combination of instance template and Startup Script, we can create any number of compute engine instances very quickly with exactly same configurations.
Question 12: Incorrect
Your company is designing its data lake on Google Cloud and wants to develop different ingestion pipelines to collect unstructured data from different sources. After the data is stored in Google Cloud, it will be processed in several data pipelines to build a recommendation engine for the end users on the website. The structure of the data retrieved from the source system can change at any time. The data must be stored exactly as it was retrieved for reprocessing purpose in case the data structure is incompatible with the current processing pipelines.
How will you design an architecture to support the use case after you retrieve the data?
•	 
Send the data through the processing pipeline, and then store the processed data in a Cloud Storage bucket for reprocessing.
•	 
Send the data through the processing pipeline, and then store the processed data in a BigQuery table for reprocessing.
(Incorrect)
•	 
Store the data in a BigQuery table.
Design the processing pipelines to retrieve the data from the table.
•	 
Store the data in a Cloud Storage bucket.
Design the processing pipelines to retrieve the data from the bucket.
(Correct)
Explanation
Option A and Option B are incorrect because in both cases, processed data is stored. As per requirement, our solution must store the input data as it is in raw format for processing purpose because structure of the data retrieved from the source system can change at any time.
Option C is incorrect because we can not store raw data in BigQuery. BigQuery store only structured data.
Option D is correct choice here because in this option we are storing raw data in Cloud Storage bucket and then creating data processing pipeline using this raw data as input.
Question 13: Correct
Your company is running a solution in App Engine Standard environment. The project that contains the App Engine application has a VPC network and this VPC network is connected with company's on-premises environment via a Cloud VPN tunnel.
What solution can you suggest so that the App Engine application can access database running inside the on-premises environment?
•	 
Configure serverless VPC access.
(Correct)
•	 
Configure private services access
•	 
Configure private Google access.
•	 
Configure private Google access for on-premises hosts only.
Explanation
Serverless VPC Access enables you to connect from a serverless environment on Google Cloud directly to your VPC network. This connection makes it possible for your serverless environment to access resources in your VPC network via internal IP addresses.
With Serverless VPC Access, you create a connector in your Google Cloud project and attach it to a VPC network. You then configure your serverless services (such as Cloud Run services, App Engine apps, or Cloud Functions) to use the connector for internal network traffic.
Serverless VPC Access only allows requests to be initiated by the serverless environment. Requests initiated by a VM must use the external address of your serverless service

Please read following reference for more information
https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/serverless-vpc-access
Question 14: Incorrect
Your company is using Compute Engine instances to host its applications. There are 3 different environments: production, staging, and development environments.
The production environment is very critical and used for whole day, while other non production environments are critical during office time only.
What solution can you suggest for optimum usage of these environments which can save cost during non working office hours?
•	 
Use regular VM instances for the production environment
Use preemptible VMs for non production environments.
(Incorrect)
•	 
Create Cloud Functions to stop the non production environments after office hours and start them just before office hours.
Use Cloud Scheduler to invoke these Cloud Functions
(Correct)
•	 
Create a shell script that uses the gcloud command to change the machine type of the non production VM instances to a smaller machine type outside of office hours.
Create a cron job on one of the production environment VM instance that will execute this shell script at regular scheduled time to automate the task
•	 
Deploy the non production VM instances using a Managed Instance Group and enable autoscaling.
Explanation
Option A is incorrect because preemptible VM can be stopped any time with short notice of 30 seconds. So in this case it is not good choice even for development and staging environment as well.
Option C is incorrect because even if machine type is changed after office hours, it will still incur some cost and It's not good practice to schedule such script on production environment. Ideally production environment should not have access to any other environment. So this script will not work even if it is scheduled on production environment.
Option D look like a close call but it is also incorrect because minimum number of instances in case of autoscaling group is one.
Option B is most accurate choice here because it will stop all the VMs in development and staging environment after office hours and start them just before office hours.
Question 15: Incorrect
Your company has an enterprise application running on GCE VM instances. This application has requirement of high availability and high performance. The application has been deployed on two instances in two zones in the same region where one instance is active instance and other instance runs in passive mode.
This application writes data to a persistent disk and you need to make this application fault tolerant so that if there is a zonal failure in one zone, then data should be immediately made available to the other instance running in 2nd zone.
As Google Cloud architect how can you maximize performance of this application with minimum downtime and minimum data loss?
•	 
1. Attach a regional SSD persistent disk to the first instance.
2. In case of a zone outage, force-attach the disk to the other instance.
(Correct)
•	 
1. Create a GCS bucket.
2. Mount this bucket into the first instance with gcs-fuse.
3. If zonal failure happens, then mount the same GCS bucket to the second instance with gcs-fuse
(Incorrect)
•	 
1. Create a persistent SSD disk for first instance.
2. Create a snapshot of this SSD persistent disk every 30 minutes.
3. If zonal failure happens, then recreate a persistent SSD disk from last snapshot and attach that disk with the second instance running in 2nd zone
•	 
1. Use a local SSD disk with the first instance.
2. Attach a persistent disk with 2nd VM instance running in 2nd zone.
2. Execute rsync command every 30 minutes where the target is a persistent SSD disk attached with 2nd VM instance
3. If zonal failure happens, then use the second instance.
Explanation
Option C and Option D are incorrect because in both cases, 30 minutes of data can still be lost because snapshot or rsync happen at an interval of 30 minutes.
Option B is incorrect because using Cloud Storage Bucket as disk via gcs-fuse is not a good choice as it will be very slow as compare to persistent disk
Option A is correct choice here because in case of regional persistent disk, data is automatically copied in multiple zones. In case of zone outage; just start a new VM in another zone and force-attach the existing disk; will work perfectly fine.
Question 16: Correct
Your team want to deploy a web application in GKE cluster. You need to ensure that application is highly scalable so that it can handle the high number of concurrent users.
How can you ensure that latency of this application stays below a certain threshold?
•	 
Do load testing of application for expected number of concurrent users via load testing tool and inspect the results.
•	 
Enable autoscaling on the GKE cluster and enable horizontal pod autoscaling on your application deployments.
Validate the autoscaling of cluster via curl request.
(Correct)
•	 
Create multiple GKE cluster in every cloud region in GCP and deploy application in each cluster.
Use global HTTP(S) load balancer to load balance the traffic among all clusters.
•	 
Use Service Mesh to understand the latency between the different microservices.
Explanation
Option B is correct choice here because once horizonal pod autoscaling is configured then GKE cluster will automatically adjust number of pods required for your application based on the application traffic.
When you first deploy your workload to a Kubernetes cluster, you may not be sure about its resource requirements and how those requirements might change based on usage patterns, external dependencies, or other factors.
Horizontal Pod autoscaling helps to ensure that your workload functions consistently in different situations, and allows you to control costs by only paying for extra capacity when you need it.
It's not always easy to predict the indicators that show whether your workload is under-resourced or under-utilized. The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler can automatically scale the number of Pods in your workload.

There is no need to deploy same application on multiple cluster like Option C. It is unnecessary pain.

Please read following reference for more information
https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/horizontalpodautoscaler
Question 17: Correct
Your company has developed a recommendation engine for its customers which is exposed via a REST API for its customers where user will provide a user ID as input and the REST API will return a list of recommendations as output for the given user ID.
You need to manage the API lifecycle. You also need to ensure stability for your customers in case the API makes backward-incompatible changes.
As a Google Cloud architect what solution you would like to suggest as per Google Cloud recommendations?
•	 
Create a distribution list of all customers.
Use this distribution list to inform customers of an upcoming backward incompatible change at least one month before replacing the old API with the new API.
•	 
Use a versioning strategy that will add the suffix 'DEPRECATED' to the current API version number in case API changes are backward-incompatible.
Use the current version number for the new API.
•	 
Use a versioning strategy for the APIs that increases the version number on every backward incompatible change.
(Correct)
•	 
Generate API documentation in automated manner.
Set up CI/CD pipeline in way, that will update the public API documentation whenever new API is deployed.
Explanation
Option C is correct choice here because increasing the version number will inform client that new API might introduce breaking changes.

Question 18: Incorrect
Your company is developing a microservices application on GKE cluster.  You need to simulate and validate how application will respond in case one of the microservice crash all of a sudden.
As Google Cloud Architect, what solution you would like to suggest?
•	 
Destroy one node in GKE cluster to validate required failure scenario
•	 
Configure Istio in GKE cluster.
Use traffic management feature of Istio to divert the traffic away from a crashing microservice.
(Incorrect)
•	 
Add bug in one of the microservice code and redeploy that service in cluster
•	 
Use Istio's fault injection feature.
With this fault injection feature, you can simulate the behavior where one of the microservice is faulty
(Correct)
Explanation
Istio is an open service mesh that provides a uniform way to connect, manage, and secure microservices. It supports managing traffic flows between services, enforcing access policies, and aggregating telemetry data, all without requiring changes to the microservice code.
Istio gives you:
Automatic load balancing for HTTP, gRPC, WebSocket, MongoDB, and TCP traffic.

Question 19: Incorrect
For a web application, how can you ensure that production deployment of application is linked to source code commits?
This deployment process should be fully auditable.
•	 
All developers must follow practice of tagging the code commit with commit timestamp.
•	 
All developers must follow practice of adding a comment to the commit that tells which commit is used for a particular commit.
(Incorrect)
•	 
Make sure that container tag match the source code commit hash
(Correct)
•	 
All developers must follow practice of tagging the code commits with :latest
Explanation
Option A , Option B and Option D are just adding a tag or comment on source code only. This way we can not establish the relationship between deployment (container image) and source code commit after which this deployment was built.
Relationship between deployment (container image) and source code commit can be established by adding a tag to container image with tag value as source code commit.

Your team needs to deploy application on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster. This application need access to third-party services on the internet.
As per company policy, no Compute Engine VM instance can have a public IP address in GCP.
How can you create a deployment strategy that meets these guidelines?
•	 
Configure the GKE cluster as a private cluster.
Configure Cloud NAT Gateway for the cluster subnet.
(Correct)
•	 
Configure the GKE cluster as a private cluster.
Configure Private Google Access in the VPC in which cluster nodes are created.
•	 
Configure the Kubernetes cluster as a route-based cluster.
Configure Private Google Access on the VPC in which cluster nodes are created.
•	 
Install a NAT Proxy on one Compute Engine VM Instance.
Configure all workloads on Kubernetes in a way that all request for third-party services on internet pass through this proxy.
Explanation
Private clusters
By default, all nodes in a GKE cluster have public IP addresses. A good practice is to create private clusters, which gives all worker nodes only private RFC 1918 IP addresses. Private clusters enforce network isolation, reducing the risk exposure surface for your clusters. Using private clusters means that by default only clients inside your network can access services in the cluster. In order to allow external services to reach services in your cluster, you can use an HTTP(S) load balancer or a network load balancer.

Private clusters in GKE gives you the ability to isolate nodes from having inbound and outbound connectivity to the public internet. This isolation is achieved as the nodes have internal IP addresses only.
If you want to provide outbound internet access for certain private nodes, you can use Cloud NAT or manage your own NAT gateway.

Your company wants to store some critical data in a GCS bucket. and your company needs to rotate the encryption key used to encrypt the data in the bucket. This data will be processed in Cloud Dataflow.
As per Google Cloud's recommendation for the security, what solution would you like to suggest for this use case?
•	 
Create a key with Cloud Key Management Service (KMS).
Use encrypt method of Cloud KMS to encrypt the data.
•	 
Create a key with Cloud Key Management Service (KMS).
Set the encryption key on the bucket to the Cloud KMS key.
(Correct)
•	 
Generate a symmetric key.
Encrypt the data using above key.
Upload the encrypted data to the GCS bucket.
Use same key to decrypt data at the time of data read.
•	 
Generate an AES-256 encryption key.
Encrypt the data in the bucket using the customer-supplied encryption key feature.
Explanation
All the data on Cloud Storage Bucket is encrypted. By default this encryption happens via Google Managed encryption keys.  But in place of using Google Managed encryption keys, you can choose to use keys generated by Cloud Key Management Service. Such keys are known as customer- managed encryption keys. You can use customer-managed encryption keys on individual objects, or configure your bucket to use a key by default on all new objects added to a bucket.

If you use a customer-managed encryption key, your encryption keys are stored within Cloud KMS. The project that holds your encryption keys can then be independent from the project that contains your buckets, thus allowing for better separation of duties.

Your company wants to do outsourcing of operation functions. They want their developers to deploy new versions of application in staging environment for verification purpose. After verification in staging environment, they want to allow the outsourced operations team to promote this verified deployment version to production environment.
Which GCP products should you use to minimize the operation overhead of the solution?
•	 
App Engine
(Correct)
•	 
GKE On-Prem
•	 
Compute Engine
•	 
Google Kubernetes Engine
Explanation
App engine has less operation overhead as compare to any other option.
GKE and Compute engine services are more flexible but has more operation overhead.
Question 23:

Your company needs to design a Data Warehousing solution in GCP. Your team wants to store secured data in BigQuery. Your team requires you to have the encryption keys generated outside GCP.
As a cloud architect what solution would you like to suggest for this?
•	 
Generate a new key in Cloud Key Management Service (Cloud KMS).
Store all the data in GCS Bucket using the customer-managed key and select the key created in previous step.
Set up dataflow processing pipeline to read data from GCS bucket, decrypt this data and then store it in a new BigQuery dataset.
•	 
Generate a new key in Cloud Key Management Service (Cloud KMS).
Create a dataset in BigQuery using the customer-managed key and select the key created in previous step.
•	 
Import a key in Cloud Key Management Service (Cloud KMS).
Store all the data in GCS Bucket using the customer-managed key and select the key created in previous step.
Set up a Dataflow processing pipeline to read data from GCS bucket, decrypt this data and then store it in a new BigQuery dataset.
•	 
Import a key in Cloud Key Management Service (Cloud KMS).
Create a dataset in BigQuery using the customer-managed key and select the key created in previous step.
(Correct)
Explanation
BigQuery encrypts customer content stored at rest. BigQuery handles and manages this default encryption for you without any additional actions on your part.
If you want to control encryption yourself, you can use customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) for BigQuery. Instead of Google managing the encryption keys that protect your data, you control and manage encryption keys in Cloud KMS

Please read the following reference for more information
https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/customer-managed-encryption

Since key needs to be generated outside GCP, so we can import that key in KMS to be used by BigQuery.

Question 24: 
Skipped
Your company has a project in GCP with 3 VPCs. There is one VM instance in each VPC.
Network subnets inside VPC do not overlap with each other and these subnets must remain separated.
This network configuration is as following
 
For your company, Instance1 is a special case where this instance must communicate directly with other 2 instances via internal IPs.
As cloud architect, what solution would you like to suggest?
•	 
Add two additional (Network Interface Card) NICs to instance1 with the following configuration
1. NIC1
          VPC: VPC2
          Subnetwork: Subnet2
2. NIC2
          VPC: VPC3
          Subnetwork: Subnet3 
Update firewall rules in VPC to enable
1. traffic between instances1 and Instance 2 via NIC1.
2. traffic between instances1 and Instance 3 via NIC2.
(Correct)
•	 
Create one cloud router between subnet1 and subnet2 to advertise IP addresses of subnet2 to subnet#1
Create 2nd cloud router between subnet1 and subnet3 to advertise IP addresses of subnet3 to subnet#1
•	 
Create two VPN tunnels via Cloud VPN
1 Between VPC#1 and VPC#2
1 Between VPC#2 and VPC#3
Update firewall rules to enable traffic between instances. 
•	 
Establish VPC Peering connection as following
Peer VPC#1 with VPC#2.
Peer VPC#2 with VPC#3
Update firewall rules to allow traffic between instances. 
Explanation
Multiple NIC can be attached with a VM instance and each NIC can be assigned different IP. By adding 2 NIC as per Option A, instance 1 will also be considered as an instance in VPC#2 and VPC3.
Via NIC1 , instance# 1 and instance#2 can communicate via internal IP of subnet 2
Via NIC2 , instance# 1 and instance#3 can communicate via internal IP of subnet 3

Cloud Router option (Option B) is not right choice, because use of Cloud router alone is not sufficient. To enable communication between VM's via private IP, either they must be in same subnet of same VPC or they must be connected via VPN gateway or Cloud Interconnect if those VM's are in different VPC.  Since this question did not mention anything about VPN or Cloud Interconnect, so Option B is not right choice here
Question 25: 
Skipped
Your company has an application deployed in a GKE cluster. You have three clusters for development, staging and production environments.
Your operation team found that the team can do application deployment to the production cluster without first testing the application in lower environments like development and staging environment.
As operation team head, You want team to be autonomous but want to prevent the direct production deployment.
As Google Cloud architect, what solution you can suggest to achieve this quickly with less effort?
•	 
First, configure the binary authorization policies for all GKE clusters, development. staging and production clusters.
Set up a CI/CD pipeline that require the attestations as part of the pipeline processing.
(Correct)
•	 
Create an IAM group of all team leads
Create a policy to allow team leads in this group to do deployment on production GKE cluster
•	 
Create a GKE lifecycle hook to prevent the container from starting if container image is not approved for usage in the given environment.
•	 
Implement a corporate policy to prevent teams from deploying Docker images to an environment unless the Docker image was tested in an earlier environment.
Explanation
Binary Authorization is a deploy-time security control that ensures only trusted container images are deployed on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) or Cloud Run. With Binary Authorization, you can require images to be signed by trusted authorities during the development process and then enforce signature validation when deploying. By enforcing validation, you can gain tighter control over your container environment by ensuring that only verified images are integrated into the build-and-release process.

You company wants to use Cloud SQL MySQL database for business critical transaction data.
Which two features should you implement to ensure that the minimum amount of data is lost in case of disaster event?
•	 
Sharding
•	 
Read replicas
(Correct)
•	 
Binary logging
•	 
Automated backups
(Correct)
•	 
Semisynchronous replication
Explanation
Sharding is a way to distribute data among multiple database nodes in a way that each node contains subset of data. It makes data read and write faster. Sharding can not help in controlling data loss

In case of disaster, to ensure minimum data loss must to following things
1. Run Cloud SQL in HA mode. It will provide high availability in case zonal outage.
2. Take Regular backup of data. It will help in creating a new instance faster
3. Create cross region read replica. It will ensure minimum data loss in case of disaster event.

We can following architecture for disaster recovery in GCP
Before Disaster
 

After Disaster Recovery
 

Prerequisites for creating a read replica
1. Before you can create a read replica of a primary Cloud SQL instance, the instance must meet the following requirements:
Automated backups must be enabled.
2. Binary logging must be enabled which requires point-in-time recovery to be enabled. Learn more about the impact of these logs.
3. At least one backup must have been created after binary logging was enabled.

It means creating read replica already covers binary logging.

Your company is using BigQuery in Google Cloud Project. Company's on-premise environment is connected to Google Cloud via VPN tunnel.
What solution can you suggest to ensure security in this system to avoid data exfiltration and accidental oversharing?
•	 
Configure VPC Service Controls and configure Private Google Access
(Correct)
•	 
Configure Private Google Access for on-premises only
•	 
Perform the following task
1. Create a service account.
2. Give the role to run BigQuery Jobs to the service account.
3. Remove all other IAM access from the project
•	 
Use Private Google Access.
Explanation
VPC Service Control helps in following things
1. Mitigate exfiltration risks by isolating multi-tenant services
2. Ensure sensitive data can only be accessed from authorized networks
3. Restrict resource access to allowed IP addresses, identities, and trusted client devices
4. Control which Google Cloud services are accessible from a VPC network

Private Google Access
Private Google Access offers private connectivity to hosts either in a VPC network or on-premises network that use private IP addresses to access Google APIs and services.
VM instances that only have internal IP addresses (no external IP addresses) can use Private Google Access. They can reach the external IP addresses of Google APIs and services. The source IP address of the packet can be the primary internal IP address of the network interface or an address in an alias IP range that is assigned to the interface.

Question 28: 
Skipped
Your company has a simple application which is deployed as single pod on GKE cluster. This application pulls messages from Pub/Sub and does some heavy I/O operation while processing messaging.
Your found that the application is slow in processing these messages after analyzing Pub/Sub metrics. Application is not able to process the messages in real time. Most of messages have to wait before being pulled by application for processing.

What solution can you suggest to fix this issue?
•	 
Use the --enable-autoscaling flag while creating GKE cluster
•	 
Use subscription/push_request_latencies metric to configure autoscaling of GKE cluster deployment
•	 
Use subsription/num_undelivered_messages metric to configure autoscaling of GKE cluster deployment
(Correct)
•	 
Configure GKE cluster deployment autoscaling based on CPU utilization.
Also configure minimum and maximum limit on number of nodes in this cluster.
Explanation
subscription/push_request_latencies metric helps you in understanding your push endpoint's response latency distribution. Because of the limit on the number of outstanding messages, endpoint latency affects subscription throughput. If it takes 100 milliseconds to process each message, your throughput limit is likely to be 10 messages per second.
With this metrics we can not determine how much scaling is needed. Because processing time of each subscriber will still remain nearly same even after scaling.
Ideally our subscriber should consume message from subscription as soon as possible. Pub/Sub generally limits the number of outstanding messages. You should aim for fewer than 1000 outstanding messages in most situations. If we increase our subscriber count then number of undelivered messages count will go down accordingly. So Option C is better choice in this case.

Your company's on-premises data center is connected with Google cloud via 1Gbps connection bandwidth. You need to migrate their 10TB on-premises database into GCS bucket.
What solution will you recommend to perform this data export.? Your goal is to minimize the data transfer cost and minimize load on database in on-premises data center.
•	 
Develop a dataflow job that will read data from database and write it into GCS bucket.
•	 
Use a Hadoop job in Dataproc cluster solution that will read data from database and write it into GCS bucket.
•	 
Do offline data migration by using Data Transfer appliance.
•	 
Zip the input data and upload it with gsutil -m command.
It will copy data faster by doing multi-threaded copy.
(Correct)
Explanation
The two main criteria to consider with Transfer Appliance are cost and speed. With reasonable network connectivity (for example, 1 Gbps), transferring 100 TB of data online takes over 10 days to complete. If this rate is acceptable, an online transfer is likely a good solution for your needs.

The expected turnaround time for a network appliance to be shipped, loaded with your data, shipped back, and rehydrated on Google Cloud is 50 days. If your calculated online transfer timeframe is substantially more than this timeframe, consider Transfer Appliance. The total cost for the 480 TB device process is less than $3,000.

 
As per this table it will take around 30 hours to migrate data with 1Gbps which very less as compare to turn around time of Transfer appliance.

One team in your company has been running one application in Google Cloud.  This team has recently started using Cloud Pub/Sub with this application. Due to increase in load on the application servers, this application has started giving many timeout error. This application is not logging any Pub/Sub publishing errors. You want to improve publishing latency.
As Google Cloud architect what will you suggest in this case?
•	 
Create more Pub/Sub message queues
•	 
Use Push model of Pub/Sub for subscription
•	 
Increase the Pub/Sub total timeout retry value
•	 
Stop using Pub/Sub message batching
(Correct)
Explanation
Batching messages
The Pub/Sub client libraries batch multiple messages into a single call to the service. Larger batch sizes increase message throughput (rate of messages sent per CPU). The cost of batching is latency for individual messages, which are queued in memory until their corresponding batch is filled and ready to be sent over the network. To minimize latency, batching should be turned off. This is particularly important for applications that publish a single message as part of a request-response sequence.

In your company, public IP addresses was assigned by mistake to backend application servers. This public IP address assignment made these backend servers accessible from the internet.
In your organization how can you ensure that public IP addresses can not be assigned to backend server by any one. External IP addresses should be assigned to frontend servers only.
•	 
Create an Organizational Policy with a constraint that will allow public IP addresses only on the frontend servers only.
(Correct)
•	 
Create VM instances using Deployment Manager and do manual review of deployment configuration yaml file to ensure that public IP is not assigned to VM instances
•	 
Create an identity and Access Management (IAM) policy that will revoke permission to create public IP address in your project
•	 
Create a custom Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that will revoke permission to create public IP address
Create a policy at project level that associate this role with all users in your project.
Explanation
Rules created at Organization Policy level have highest priority. These rules even have more priority than IAM policy defined at other resource level like Project, Folder and  Organization.
So if we define deny rule as Organization Policy with a constraint to allow external IP addresses only on the frontend Compute Engine instances then no one can assign public IP address to any other instance even by mistake.

There is a single Dedicated Interconnect connection between your primary on-premises data center and Google Cloud. This connection should adheres to  following policies:
1. Any on-premise server with private IP should connect to cloud resources via private IP of cloud resources.
2. Egress traffic from production network management servers to GCE virtual machines should never use public internet.
3. Network should meet SLA (Service level Agreement) of any business critical application.
What solution will you suggest to meet these requirements.
•	 
Add a new Dedicated Interconnect connection.
(Correct)
•	 
Upgrade the bandwidth on the Dedicated Interconnect connection to 100G
•	 
Add four new Cloud VPN connections.
•	 
Use a new Carrier Peering connection.
Explanation
Dedicated Interconnect provides direct physical connections between your on-premises network and Google's network. Dedicated Interconnect enables you to transfer large amounts of data between networks, which can be more cost-effective than purchasing additional bandwidth over the public internet.

For the highest level availability, it is recommended to set up configuration for 99.99% availability as the base configuration, as shown in the following diagram. Clients in the on-premises network can reach the IP addresses of virtual machine (VM) instances in the us-central1 region through at least one of the redundant paths. If one path is unavailable, the other paths can continue to serve traffic.
      
As per Google recommendation:
With 100 Gbps Dedicated Interconnect, you can scale your connection capacity to meet your particular requirements. Connect up to 2x 100G transport circuits for private cloud traffic to Google Cloud at any of our POPs.

Your company needs to design Google Cloud network architecture for GKE cluster. This cluster will be used to run business critical internet facing application. As per Google Cloud's best practices, how will you design this network so that you can manage this cluster from your data center and there is very less chances of attack from malicious attacker?
•	 
Create a public cluster with master authorized networks enabled and firewall rules.
•	 
Create a public cluster with firewall rules and Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) routes
•	 
Create a private cluster with a private endpoint with master authorized networks configured.
•	 
Create a private cluster with public endpoint with master authorized networks configured.
(Correct)
Explanation
In a private cluster, nodes only have internal IP addresses, which means that nodes and Pods are isolated from the internet by default.
In private clusters, the control plane (master) has a private and public endpoint. There are three configuration combinations to control access to the cluster endpoints:

1. Public endpoint access disabled: creates a private cluster with no client access to the public endpoint.
2. Public endpoint access enabled, authorized networks enabled: creates a private cluster with limited access to the public endpoint.
3. Public endpoint access enabled, authorized networks disabled: creates a private cluster with unrestricted access to the public endpoint.

As per this, Option D is the right choice because with this Option D, we can create cluster where all nodes and pods will be assigned private IP only and master control can be accessed only from authorized network (means inside Google Cloud VPC and from on-premises network)

Your company wants to scale existing business critical application. They have customers across the globe. For this application, GKE cluster will be used to host the application. Currently, company is not interested in migrating its existing MySQL on-premises database to cloud. So application servers need high speed, consistent and highly available connectivity between their on-premises data center and Google Cloud to access on-premises database.
As per Google's recommended practices for production-level applications, what solution will you suggest for hybrid connectivity between your company's on-premises systems and Google Cloud?
•	 
Configure two dedicated interconnect connections in one metro (City) and two connections in another metro.
Ensure that Interconnect connections are placed in different metro zones.
(Correct)
•	 
Configure two Partner interconnect connections in one metro (City).
Ensure that Interconnect connections are placed in different metro zones.
•	 
Configure Direct Peering between your data center and Google Cloud.
Ensure that you are peering at least two Google locations.
•	 
Configure two or more VPN connections from on-premises to Google Cloud.
Ensure that VPN devices in on-premises data center are in separate racks.
Explanation
For the highest level availability, Google recommend the configuration for 99.99% availability as the base configuration, as shown in the following diagram. Clients in the on-premises network can reach the IP addresses of virtual machine (VM) instances in the us-centra-1 region through at least one of the redundant paths. If one path is unavailable, the other paths can continue to serve traffic.

 

Only Option A follows this architecture. Also for consistency and high speed requirement, Dedicated connection is a preferred choice.

You want to build an application and you are interested in using serverless Cloud Functions for backend services.
In your application, you have requirements that cloud Function functionA should be able to invoke another Cloud Function functionB.
As per Google Cloud recommendation, what solution will you suggest to ensure that functionB accept request from functionA only.
•	 
Make functionB 'Require authentication'
Make functionB only accept internal traffic.
Create both Cloud Functions in the same VPC.
Create an ingress firewall for functionB to only allow traffic from functionA .
•	 
Make functionB 'Require authentication'.
Create a unique service account and associate it to functionA.
Grant the service account invoker role for functionB .
Create an id token in functionA and pass the token with request when invoking functionB.
(Correct)
•	 
Create a token and pass it in as an environment variable to functionA.
While invoking functionB, include the token in the request.
Pass the same token to functionB
Reject the invocation if the tokens are different.
•	 
Create two functions in the same project and VPC.
Make functionB only accept internal traffic.
Create an ingress firewall for functionB to only allow traffic from functionA.
Ensure that both functions use the same service account.
Explanation
There are two approaches to controlling access for Cloud Functions:
Identity-based
1. Evaluating credentials that the entity presents to ensure that it is who it says it is (Authentication).
2. Allowing that entity to access your resources based on what permissions that identity has been granted (Authorization).
Network-based
You can also limit access by specifying network settings for individual functions. This allows for fine-tuned control over the network ingress and egress to and from your functions.

Authenticating function to function calls
When building services that connect multiple functions, it's a good idea to ensure that each function can only send requests to a specific subset of your other functions. For instance, if you have a login function, it should be able to access the user profiles function, but it probably shouldn't be able to access the search function.

To configure the receiving function to accept requests from a specific calling function, you need to add the calling function's service account as a member on the receiving function and grant that member the Cloud Functions Invoker (roles/cloudfunctions.invoker) role.

Your company has a legacy web application running in on-premises data center. You want to use Google Cloud to monitor this application.
In case of application failure or during maintenance, you want to redirect users to a "Application is not available" page as soon as possible. Your Operation team should be able to receive a notification for the issue.
What solution will you suggest for this requirement? You also have goal to minimize the cost.
•	 
Use Cloud Error Reporting to check the application URL.
In case of failure, switch the URL to the "Application is not available" page
Notify the Operation team about this incident.
•	 
Create a Cloud Monitoring uptime check to validate the application URL.
In case of health check failure, send a message to Pub/Sub queue.
Create a Cloud Function that subscribe to this event.
This Cloud Function will switch the URL to the "Application is not available" page, and notify the Operation team.
(Correct)
•	 
Create a cron job on a GCE VM instance that runs every 30 seconds.
The cron job invokes a shell script to check the application URL.
In case of failure, switch the URL to the "Application is not available" page, and notify the Operation team.
•	 
Create a schedule job in Cloud Run to invoke a container every 30 seconds.
The container will check the application URL.
In case of failure, switch the URL to the "Application is not available" page, and notify the Operation team.
Explanation
An uptime check is a request sent to a resource to see if it responds. You can use uptime checks to determine the availability of a VM instance, an App Engine service, a URL, or an AWS load balancer.
You can monitor the availability of a resource by creating an alerting policy that creates an incident if the uptime check fails. The alerting policy can be configured to notify you by email or through a different channel, and that notification can include details about the resource that failed to respond. You also have the option to observe the results of uptime checks in the Monitoring uptime-check dashboards.

Your company has about 1 petabyte (PB) of critical data in on-premises data center. You want to export this data to GCS bucket . There is a 1-Gbps interconnect link between on-premises data center and Google Cloud. Other team wants to use data stored in GCS bucket after one month.
What solution will you suggest for such data export?
•	 
Use Transfer Appliances from Google Cloud to export the data to Google's Cloud storage bucket.
(Correct)
•	 
Export files to an encrypted USB device
Send the device to Google
Request Google cloud for import of the data to Cloud Storage bucket from this USB device.
•	 
Ensure that there are no other users consuming the 1Gbps link
Use multi-thread transfer using gcloud -m command line utility to transfer data to Cloud Storage.
•	 
Use the Storage Transfer service from Google Cloud to export the data from on-premises data center to Cloud Storage bucket.
Explanation
With 1Gbps, it can take 124 or more number of days to transfer 1 PB of data, so gsutil and Storage Transfer service is not right choice here in this case because both are dependent on network bandwidth.

So only correct choice for this case is Option A, which suggest to request for Transfer Appliance.

Your company wants to convert a monolithic application into RESTful microservices. Your team want to run those microservices on Cloud Run by using Docker containers. Your application has customer across the globe.
How can you ensure that these services are highly available? Also, customers expect low latency from your solution?
•	 
Deploy Cloud Run services in multiple regions.
Create serverless network endpoint groups pointing to the services.
Use serverless NEG's as a backend service for the global HTTP(S) Load Balancer.
(Correct)
•	 
Deploy Cloud Run services to multiple availability zones.
Create Cloud Endpoints that point for these services.
Create a global HTTP(S) Load Balancer.
Attach the Cloud Endpoints as backend service for above load balancer.
•	 
Deploy Cloud Run services in multiple regions.
Configure Cloud DNS to route traffic based on latency.
•	 
Deploy Cloud Run services in multiple availability zones.
Create a TCP/IP global load balancer.
Add the Cloud Run Endpoints as backend services for above load balancer.
Explanation
This is how a serverless NEG fits into the HTTP(S) Load Balancing model.
 

A network endpoint group (NEG) specifies a group of backend endpoints for a load balancer. A serverless NEG is a backend that points to a Cloud Run, App Engine, or Cloud Functions service.
A serverless NEG can represent one of the following:
1. A Cloud Run service or a group of services sharing the same URL pattern.
2. A Cloud Functions function or a group of functions sharing the same URL pattern.
3. An App Engine app (Standard or Flex), a specific service within an app, a specific version of an app, or a group of services sharing the same URL pattern.
When HTTP(S) Load Balancing is enabled for serverless apps, you can:
Configure your serverless app to serve from a dedicated IPv4 and/or IPv6 IP address that is not shared with other services.
Map a single URL to multiple functionally-identical serverless applications running in different regions, allowing requests to be routed to the region closest to the user. This is supported only for Cloud Run and Cloud Functions.
Reuse the same SSL certificates and private keys that you use for Compute Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine and Cloud Storage. This eliminates the need to manage separate certificates for serverless apps.

Endpoint types
Serverless NEGs do not have any network endpoints such as ports or IP addresses. They can only point to an existing Cloud Run, App Engine, or Cloud Functions service residing in the same region as the NEG.
When you create a serverless NEG, you specify the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) of the Cloud Run, App Engine, or Cloud Functions service. The endpoint is of type SERVERLESS. Other endpoint types are not supported in a serverless NEG.
A serverless NEG cannot have more than one endpoint. Because only one endpoint is allowed in each serverless NEG, the load balancer serves as the frontend only, and proxies traffic to the specified serverless endpoint. However, if the backend service contains multiple serverless NEGs, the load balancer balances traffic between these NEGs, thus minimizing request latency.

Your team is developing an application that process and stores very sensitive documents. Team is considering Cloud Storage in Google Cloud to store these documents. Any change to these sensitive documents must be uploaded as a separate copy of the document.
For compliance requirements, how can to ensure that these documents cannot be deleted or overwritten for the next 7 years.
•	 
Generate customer-managed key in Cloud KMS.
Use above key for the encryption of the bucket data.
Rotate the key after 7 years.
•	 
Create the bucket with fine-grained access control.
Create a service account.
Assign role of Object Writer to above service account.
Use above created service account to upload new files.
•	 
Create a retention policy on the bucket for the duration of 7 years.
Create a lock on the retention policy.
(Correct)
•	 
Create the bucket with uniform bucket-level access control.
Create a service account.
Assign role of Object Writer to above service account.
Use above created service account to upload new files.
Explanation
Bucket Lock feature allows you to configure a data retention policy for a Cloud Storage bucket that governs how long objects in the bucket must be retained. The feature also allows you to lock the data retention policy, permanently preventing the policy from being reduced or removed.

This feature can provide immutable storage on Cloud Storage. In conjunction with Detailed audit logging mode, which logs Cloud Storage request and response details, Bucket Lock can help with regulatory and compliance requirements, such as those associated with FINRA, SEC, and CFTC. Bucket Lock may also help you address certain health care industry retention regulations.

You can add a retention policy to a bucket to specify a retention period.
1. If a bucket does not have a retention policy, you can delete or replace objects in the bucket at any time
2. If a bucket has a retention policy, objects in the bucket can only be deleted or replaced once their age is greater than the retention period.
3. A retention policy retroactively applies to existing objects in the bucket as well as new objects added to the bucket.

You can lock a retention policy to permanently set it on the bucket.
1. Once you lock a retention policy, you cannot remove it or reduce the retention period it has.
2. You cannot delete a bucket with a locked retention policy unless every object in the bucket has met the retention period.
3. You can increase the retention period of a locked retention policy.
4. Locking a retention policy can help your data comply with record retention regulations.

There is an existing Application which is running on Compute Engine instances which are managed via a Managed Instance Group.
Now you need to upgrade this application with some non critical update. You have created a new instance template for this non critical update.
How can you deploy this non critical update with no impact on existing VM instances? You need to ensure that only new VM instances has updated application running inside them.
•	 
Start a new rolling restart operation.
•	 
Start a new rolling replace operation.
•	 
Start a new rolling update with Proactive update mode.
•	 
Start a new rolling update with Opportunistic update mode.
(Correct)
Explanation
To automatically roll out new configuration to all or to a subset of the instances in a MIG, set the MIG's update type to PROACTIVE. If an automated update is potentially too disruptive, or you want more control over the update, set the MIG's update type to OPPORTUNISTIC then selectively update specific instances.
Opportunistic updates
When the update type is set to OPPORTUNISTIC, the MIG applies updates only when you selectively apply the update to specific instances or when new instances are created by the MIG. A MIG creates new instances when it is resized to add instances, either automatically or manually. Compute Engine does not actively initiate requests to apply opportunistic updates.
In certain scenarios, an opportunistic update is useful because you don't want to cause instability to the system if it can be avoided. For example, if you have a non-critical update that can be applied as necessary without any urgency and you have a MIG that is actively being autoscaled, perform an opportunistic update so that Compute Engine does not actively tear down your existing instances to apply the update. When resizing down, the autoscaler preferentially terminates instances with the old template as well as instances that are not yet in a RUNNING state.

You are GCP practice head in your company. In your company, there are multiple departments and these departments need access to their own projects. Members within each department will have the same project responsibilities.
You want to set up your cloud environment in a way that require minimum maintenance.
You also need to ensure that IAM permissions are easy to set up as each department's project start and end.
What solution will you suggest for this requirement?
•	 
Create a folder for each department.
Assign the respective members of the department the required IAM permissions at the folder level.
Arrange all projects for each department under the respective folders.
•	 
Create a Google Group for each department.
Associate all department members with respective groups.
Assign each group the required IAM permissions for their respective projects.
•	 
Assign all department members the required IAM permissions for their respective projects.
•	 
Create a Google Group for each department.
Associate all department members to their respective groups.
Create a folder for each department.
Assign the respective group the required IAM permissions at the folder level.
Create the projects under the respective folders.
(Correct)
Explanation
Option A and Option C are incorrect because permissions are assigned to each member is individual member. Group is more recommended way to assign permission to members rather that giving permission to individual member.
Option B is incorrect because permission are granted at project level. Since all members in one department need same project responsibilities for all the projects so it make more sense to assign permission at folder level rather. So Option D is most appropriate choice for this.

One team in you company wants to develop a web application. This application has only few API which needs to be exposed to internet. User traffic will also be less for this application most of the time. Only on some rare occasions traffic cloud spike.
What solution will you suggest to deploy this application in cloud in cost effective way? You also need to ensure high availability of this application.
•	 
Store static content such as HTML and images in a GCS bucket.
Use Cloud Functions to host the APIs and save the user data in Firestore.
(Correct)
•	 
Use Cloud CDN to store static content such as HTML and images.
Host the APIs on App Engine.
Store the user data in Cloud SQL.
•	 
Store static content such as HTML and images in a GCS bucket.
Host the APIs on a zonal GKE cluster with worker nodes in multiple zones.
Save the user data in Cloud Spanner.
•	 
Use Cloud CDN to store static content such as HTML and images.
Use cloud Run to host the APIs.
Save the user data in Cloud SQL.
Explanation
Since traffic is very low, so serverless option is better choice in such case because in case of serverless deployment, there will be no charge if there is no traffic. So With this point, Both Option A and Option D looks like correct choice. Option B can also be correct choice if App Engine standard environment is used.
But I think Option A is best choice among all possible cases because only few number of API needs to be hosted. So Cloud Function will cost lesser in this case as compare to other choices.
Also Firestore is better option to store user data as compare to Cloud SQL.
